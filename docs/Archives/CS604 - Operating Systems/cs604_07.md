# Lecture No. 07

## The `#!cpp wait()` System Call

The `#!cpp wait()` system call suspends a `process` until one of its immediate `children` terminates or stops.  
It returns early if a signal is received or immediately if no `children` are active.  
On success, it returns the `PID` of a `child`.  
If the `parent` terminates, its `children` are reparented to `init`, which collects their status.

### Zombie Process

A `zombie process` is a `process` that has terminated but whose exit status has not yet been received by its `parent process` or by `init`.

## The `#!cpp execlp()` System Call

After `#!cpp fork()`, `#!cpp execlp()` is typically used by one `process` to replace its memory with a new `program` from an executable file or interpreter data.  
A successful `#!cpp execlp()` does not return, as the original `process` image is replaced.  
This allows the two `processes` to communicate and then operate independently.

```cpp
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main () {

	int pid, status;

    pid = fork();

    if (pid == -1) {
        perror("fork failed"); // Use perror for better error message
        exit(1);
    }

    if (pid == 0) { /* Child */
        if (execlp("/bin/ls", "ls", NULL) < 0) {
            printf("exec failed\n");
            exit(1);
        }
    } 
    
    else { /* Parent */
        wait(&status);
        printf("Well done, kid!\n");
        exit(0);
    }
	
	return 0;
}
```

## Cooperating Processes

`Processes` in an `OS` can be independent or cooperating.  
`Independent processes` do not affect others, while cooperating processes share data.  
`Cooperating processes` offer benefits like:

- **Information Sharing**: Multiple users access shared resources.
- **Computation Speedup**: Tasks are divided into parallel subtasks on multiprocessor systems.
- **Modularity**: Systems are organized into separate `processes` or `threads`.
- **Convenience**: Users can perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
    

**Example**:  
The producer-consumer problem illustrates communication between `processes`.  
A `producer` generates data for a `consumer`, requiring a shared buffer.  
Synchronization ensures the `consumer` waits if the buffer is empty, and the `producer` waits if full.  
Buffers can be bounded (fixed size) or unbounded (no size limit), implemented via inter-process communication or shared memory.

```cpp
#define BUFFER_SIZE 10
typedef struct {
	// ...
} item;

item buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];

int in = 0;
int out = 0;
```

The shared buffer is a circular array with two `pointers`:

- `in` points to the next free slot.
- `out` points to the next full slot.  
    The buffer is **empty** when `#!cpp in == out`, and **full** when `#!cpp (in + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE == out`.

```cpp
// Producer Process
while (1) {
    /* Produce an item in nextProduced */
    while (((in + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE) == out) {
        /* do nothing */
    }
    buffer[in] = nextProduced;
    in = (in + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE;
}

// Consumer Process
while (1) {
    while (in == out) {
        /* do nothing */
    }
    nextConsumed = buffer[out];
    out = (out + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE;
    /* Consume the item in nextConsumed */
}
```
