## Layered Approach

The benefit of this approach is modularity.  
The system is made up of different layers.  
The bottom layer is the `hardware` layer and the upper layer is called the `user interface` layer.  
The middle (layer - M) is the `operating system`[^1] layer which consists of `data structures` and `routines` which can be invoked by higher layers.  
It also simplifies debugging and system verification.  
Though it is less efficient as it creates overhead with each `system call`.

### Example

- The `operating system`[^1] by `Dijkstra`
- IBM's OS/2

## Micro Kernels

This method structures the `operating system`[^1] by removing all non essential components of the `kernel` and implement `system` and `user level` `programs`.  
This results into smaller (micro) `kernels` which provide communication facilities between `client program` and various `services` also running in the `user space`.  
It also provides minimum process and memory management.  
This provides easy of extending the `operating system`[^1] or making it run on different hardware designs because most of the time, the `kernel` doesn't need to be modified as the new `services` are added to `user space` and even if `kernel` _does_ need to be modified then those changes are very small.

### Examples

- Mach
- MacOS X Server
- QNX
- OS/2
- Windows NT

## Virtual Machines

Conceptually, a computer is made up of different layers.

1. Hardware
2. `Kernel`
3. `System programs`
4. `Application programs`

Each layer has access to layers below it.

`Non virtual machines` vs `virtual machines`

There are 2 advantages of `virtual machines` despite the fact that they are hard to implement.

- They provides a robust level of security.
- `System development` to be done without disrupting `normal system operation`.

### Java Virtual Machine

The `JVM` loads, verifies and executes the `java bytecode`.

### Examples

Following are the examples of `virtual machines`.[^1]

- VMWare
- Virtual PC
- Virtual Box

## System Design and Implementation

### Design Goals

At the highest level, the design of the system will be affected by the choice of `hardware` and `type of system`.  
Beyond this, requirements might be much harder to specify and can be divided into 2 groups.

- User goals
- System goals

An important design goal is separation of `mechanism` and `policies`.

#### Mechanism

They determine how to do something and a general mechanism is more `desirable`.

##### Example

`CPU Protection`[^2]

#### Policy

Determine what will be done.

##### Example

Initial value in the `counter` used for `CPU protection`.[^2]

---

This separation is important because [policies](#policy) can change over place or time.

### Implementation

Back then, `operating systems`[^1] were written in `assembly language` but now a days, we use `C` or `C++` for that as the code is written faster, is more compact, easier to understand and easier to `port`.

## Unix / Linux Directory Structure

### History

`Dennis Ritchie` and `Ken Thomsom` wrote `UNIX` at the `Bell Labs` in `1969`.  
It was initially written in `assembly language` and a higher level language called `Bit` and was later converted to `C`.  
`Linus Torvalds`, an undergraduate student at the University of Helsinki, Finland, wrote `Linux` in `1991`.  

`UNIX` uses a `hierarchical file system structure` consisting of a `root directory` denoted as `/` with other directories and files hanging under it.  

A `path` is separated by `/` and last component of it can be either a `file` or a `directory`.

When you login, the system places you in `home directory` (also called the `login directory`) and it is referred to, by

- `~` or `$PATH` in `bash`, `sh`, `tsh`
- `$path` in `csh`, `tcsh`

The shells understand `relative` and `absolute paths`.

`Absolute path` starts with `/` meanwhile `relative path` can start with either

- `Home Directory` (`~`)
- `Current Directory`(`.`)
- `Parent Directory`(`..`)

## Commonly Used Directory Structure in Linux

### `/`

The `root directory` is similar to `C:\`, `D:\` drive in `windows` etc. But the difference here is that unlike `windows`, everything is under one, singular `root node`.

### `/bin`

These are `binaries` or `executables`, available to all `users`.

### `/boot`

This directory contains essential files for `system boot`, including `kernel image`.

### `/dev`

This directory contains all the devices which are available to `Linux`.

### `/etc`

Contains the configuration files (which are text files and are easy to edit).

#### Example

- `/etc/inittab` contains what `processes` will be started alongside `system boot`.
- `/etc/fstab` identifies file systems and their mount points.
- `/etc/passwd` is where users are defined.

### `/home`

Every available `user` is present here.

#### Example

If there are multiple users, say `chris` and `tom` then you will find

- `/home/chris`
- `/home/tom`

### `/lib`

`Shared libraries` and `kernel modules` are stored in this directory.  
These can be dynamically linked and are very similar to `DLLs` in `windows`.

### `/lost+found`

Here, linux keeps files which need to be restored after a crash or when partition has not been properly unmounted before a shutdown.

### `/mnt`

File systems can be mounted anywhere but this is the convenient place to mount temporary file systems.

### `/opt`

Often used for storage of large applications packages.

### `/proc`

This is a `virtual directory` and doesn't exist physically.  
Here, the system processes are stored.

### `/root`

The home directory for the super user (`root`).

### `/sbin`

Utilities used for system administration such as

- `halt`
- `ifconfig`
- `fdisk`

The `/sbin/init.d` are scripts which are used by `/sbin/init` to start the system.

### `/tmp`

Used to store temporary files.

### `/usr`

A shareable, read-only directory containing user applications and their support files. Key subdirectories include:

- `/usr/X11R6`: X Window System files.
- `/usr/bin`: user-accessible commands.
- `/usr/doc`: documentation for `/usr` applications.
- `/usr/include`: C compiler header files.
- `/usr/include/g++`: C++ compiler header files.
- `/usr/lib`: libraries, binaries, and object files not directly executed by users.
- `/usr/local`: locally installed software, safe from system updates.
- `/usr/man`: manual pages.
- `/usr/share`: architecture-independent, read-only data files.
- `/usr/src`: source code for installed applications and the kernel.

### `/var`

Contains variable data files such as

- Logs in `/var/log`
- Mails in `/var/mail`
- Spools in `/var/spool`
