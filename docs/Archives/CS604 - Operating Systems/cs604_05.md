# Lecture No. 05

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 28-04-2025</span>

## Browsing `UNIX` / `Linux` Directory Structure

### Displaying Directory Contents

By default, the `#!bash ls` commands takes `.` as input.

```bash
mzaid@MZaid:/mnt/g/Projects/ChuzaWick420$ ls
README.md  assets
```

```bash
mzaid@MZaid:/mnt/g/Projects/ChuzaWick420$ ls -a
.  ..  .git  README.md  assets
```

```bash
mzaid@MZaid:/mnt/g/Projects/ChuzaWick420$ ls -la
total 4
drwxrwxrwx 1 mzaid mzaid  512 Apr 17 18:12 .
drwxrwxrwx 1 mzaid mzaid  512 Apr 20 20:46 ..
drwxrwxrwx 1 mzaid mzaid  512 Apr 17 18:13 .git
-rwxrwxrwx 1 mzaid mzaid 2848 Apr 17 18:12 README.md
drwxrwxrwx 1 mzaid mzaid  512 Nov 20 14:10 assets
```

The columns represent the following

1. Entry type (`d` for directory and `-` for file) alongside permissions.
2. Number of hard links
3. Owner name
4. Group of the owner
5. Size in bytes
6. Month of last modification
7. Day of last modification
8. Time of last modification
9. Entry name

The files starting with `.` are called `dot files` or `hidden files`.

### Creating Directories

```bash
mkdir directory name
```

### Deleting Directories

```bash
rmdir directory name
```

### Changing Directories

```bash
cd directory name
```

### Display Absolute Path of Your Working Directory

```bash
pwd
```

### Copying Files

```bash
cp file_to_copy destination
```

#### Examples

Copy `READ.md` file to directory `src`.

```bash
cp README.md src/
```

Copy `READ.md` file to directory `src` and name the file `test.md`.

```bash
cp README.md src/test.md
```

### Moving Files

```bash
mv file_to_move destination
```

#### Examples

Move `READ.md` file to directory `src`.

```bash
mv README.md src/
```

Move `READ.md` file to directory `src` and name the file `test.md`.

```bash
mv README.md src/test.md
```

### Removing Files

```bash
rm file_to_remove
```

## Process Concept

The `program` can be thought of as a passive entity sitting on the disk meanwhile the `process` is the active entity in execution, associated with resources.

There are 2 types of `processes`.

1. `IO bound processes` are those which spend more time doing the IO than the computations, having many but short `CPU` bursts.
2. `CPU bound processes` are those which spend more time doing computations, having longer but less `CPU` bursts.

### Process States

#### New

The `process` is being created.

#### Running

Instructions are being executed.

#### Waiting

The process is waiting for some event to occur, such as an `IO` operation.

#### Ready

The `process` is waiting to be assigned to a processor.

#### Terminated

The `process` has finished execution.

## Process Control Block

Each `process` is represented in the `operating system` by a `process` control block, also called a `task control block`.  
It has following pieces

### Process State

The `state` can be

- New
- Ready
- Running
- Waiting
- Halted

### Program counter

The `counter` indicates the address of the next instruction to be executed for this `process`.

### `CPU` Registers

Depending on the architecture, these may vary in number of type.

- Accumulators
- Index Registers
- Stack Pointers
- General Purpose Registers
- Program Counter

### `CPU` Scheduling Information

This information includes

- Process Priority
- Pointers to Scheduling routines
- Scheduling parameters

### Memory Management Information

This includes

- Base registers
- Limit registers
- Page tables
- Segment tables

### Accounting Information

This includes

- Amount of CPU
- Real time used
- Time limits
- Account numbers
- Job or process numbers

### `IO` Status Information

This include

- List of `IO` devices allocated to the `process`.
- List of open `files`.

## Process Scheduling

Switching the `CPU` from one process to another requires us to save the `context` of currently running `process`.

### Scheduling Queues

#### Job Queue

As `processes` enter the system, they are put into a `job queue`.  
This `queue` consists of all `processes` in the system.

#### Ready Queue

This is a `linked list`, with the header containing the `pointers` to first and last [process control block](#process-control-block).  
Each [process control block](#process-control-block) includes a `pointer` to point to next one.

#### Device Queue

Each `IO` device has its own `device queue` which lists the `processes` waiting for that device to be available for use.

## Schedulers

### Long Term (job) Scheduler

Responsible for bringing `processes` from `job pool` to [ready queue](#ready-queue).

### Short Term (`CPU`) Scheduler

It selects which `processes` need to be executed next and allocates `CPU`.

---

- **Short-term scheduler**:
    - Runs frequently ($\approx$ every 100 ms).
    - Must be fast to avoid `CPU` overhead.
- **Long-term scheduler**:
    - Runs infrequently (minutes apart).
    - Controls degree of multiprogramming.
    - Balances `I/O bound` and `CPU bound` processes for system efficiency.
- **Medium-term scheduler** (in some systems):
    - Swaps processes between memory and disk (swap out / swap in).
    - Frees memory or improves job mix.
    - Uses `swap space` to store swapped-out `processes`.
