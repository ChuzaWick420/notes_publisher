# Negotiation and Closing Deal:
## Terms of purchase:
1. Are you purchasing Assets or total entity?
2. **Indemnification Clause:** This clause gives surety to buyer that if something bad happens due to something hidden then responsibility is of the seller.
3. **Payment**: Expert advice is to pay the 30% (partial) and pay the whole price within a span of an year.
