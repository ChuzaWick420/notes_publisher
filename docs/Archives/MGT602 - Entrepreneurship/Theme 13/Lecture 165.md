# Break even Analysis
- It is the point where revenue becomes equal to costs.
- It helps the firms make decisions about prices, costs and the level of sales

## Types of Costs
- **fixed:** fixed costs remain roughly the same regardless of sales / output levels
- **variable:** these change with the change in production levels or sales

Unit Contribution = Selling Price - Variable Cost  
Unit Contribution = 200 - 100  
Unit Contribution = Rs. 100  
Break-even Point = Fixed Cost / Contribution Margin  
Break-even Point = 30,000 / 100  
Break-even Point = 300 Units
