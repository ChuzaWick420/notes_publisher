# Co-Entrepreneurship:
`co-entrepreneur` is a group of 2 entrepreneurs who commit to the entrepreneurship.

`serial-entrepreneurs` are those people who establish a venture, sell it and make a new venture again.
This allows them to help making new start ups, hence becoming a `co-founder` as well.

`advisors` are also these people because they are experts.

## Issues:
1. Conflicts between personalities.
2. Personal life of both people involved.
3. Risk taking behavior.
4. Team conflicts (during expanding).
5. Sharing of profits.
6. Partnership dissolution, that means when there was no legal paper signed to address who will take how much amount of money, then there can be conflict between both people.
7. Scaling issues (due to personal preference).
