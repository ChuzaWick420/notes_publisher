- Strategy & Metrics:
    - Focused on establishing the framework within an organization for a software security assurance program.
	- This is the most fundamental step in defining security goals in a way that’s both measurable and aligned with the organization’s real business risk.

- Education & Guidance:
    - Focused on arming personnel involved in the software lifecycle with knowledge and resources to design, develop, and deploy secure software
	- With improved access to information, project teams will be better able to proactively identify and mitigate the specific security risks that apply to their organization.

- Policy & Compliance:
    - Focused on understanding and meeting external legal and regulatory requirements while also driving internal security standards to ensure compliance in a way that's aligned with the business purpose of the org.
	- A driving theme for improvement within this Practice is focus on project-level audits that gather information about the organization's behavior in order to check that expectations are being met.
