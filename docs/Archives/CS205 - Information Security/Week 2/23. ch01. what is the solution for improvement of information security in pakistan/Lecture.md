# Ch01. what is the Solution for Improvement of Information Security in Pakistan

- Generally, Pakistan Information Security is one generation behind IT deployment
- Four-layer security transformation model provides the correct sequence and focus in order to address organizational security gaps

1. Security Hardening; Security controls on IT assets & process
2. Vulnerability Management; patching
3. Security Engineering; More complex security design & solutions
4. Security Governance; Managing the information security program

## Solution for Strong Security Posture

- Management commitment (Board)
- 4 layer transformation model as security program
- Allocation of resources
- Periodic reviews for assessing progress

## Don't Repeat the Same Mistakes

- Too much governance without the underlying security hardening
- Reactive rather than intrinsic
- Lack of resources (10% of what allocated for IT)
- Management interest
