# Ch02. what is High Availability (HA)

## High Availability

- High availability of a system or component assures a high level of operational performance (uptime) for a given period of time
- High availability is a strategy
- Fault tolerance refers to a system designed in such a way that when one component fails, a backup component takes over operations immediately to avoid loss of service

## High Availability is Designed in the following Manner

- System level (data center or service)
- Device level (within single device)
- Device level (combination of multiple redundant devices)
- Alternate site level

## High Availability and Fault Tolerance

- Designed to minimize downtime with the help of redundant components

## Disaster Recovery

- A pre-planned approach for re-establishing IT functions at an alternate site
