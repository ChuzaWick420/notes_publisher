# Ch02 what is the Best Approach to Secure the it Enterprise Architecture

- The 4-layer security transformation model is the only way to effectively and practically address security posture
- 4-layer security transformation model is tried & tested for geographies where the overall security awareness & posture is weak

---

1. Security hardening: address security configuration of all IT assets which security "boxes" won't do for you
2. Vulnerability management: scanning to inspect patching of IT assets (essential)  
3. Security engineering: this is where more serious investments may be made once layers 1 & 2 have been completed satisfactorily (or are being addressed)
4. Security governance: ensure the proper utilization (as intended), ROI, and audits of purchased devices & solutions

Also ensure configs are as per design, and SOPs.
