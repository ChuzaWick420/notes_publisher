# Lecture No. 02

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 25-03-2025</span>

## Event

There could be an `occurence` in the real world (an interaction with the system) and in response to which, the particular system fires off multiple `events`.  
Every `event` is represented by an `event object` and can have multiple types, such as

- input event
- file event

## Event Processing

It is computing that performs operations on events, such as

- Reading
- Writing
- Modifying
- Deleting

## Synchronous Operations

These are the operations which need to be done before processing the next one.

## Asynchronous Operations

These are the operations which can be started and we can do something else while they are running.
