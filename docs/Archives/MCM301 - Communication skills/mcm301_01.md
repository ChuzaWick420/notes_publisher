# 01. Communication

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 21-12-2024</span>  

`Communication` is derived from the `latin` word `Communico` which means "to share".  
Therefore, it is a process of sharing information between 2 people which requires systematic and continuous speaking, listening and understanding.

## Why is it Important?

It is a skill which needs to be mastered.  
We either learn this skill by

1. Observing people and changing our behavior based on what we see.
2. Education, practice and evaluation from other people.

Your time consumption:
1. 70% for writing, reading, speaking and listening, in general, communication.
2. 69% of this communication time is speaking and listening.
3. 17% for reading.
4. 14% for writing.

## Communication Process Cycle

In an organization, a good plan may fail because of ineffective communication.

## What is Involved in the Communication Process?

### Idea

Information exists in the mind of the sender (who is the source). This can be a concept, idea, information, or feelings.

### Encoding

The sender starts to encode his ideas into words or symbols.

#### Message

This physical product of `encoding` is a `message` which can be:

1. `Speech` in speaking.
2. `Written words` in writing.
3. `Gestures`, `facial expressions` in body language.

### Channel

It is the medium used by `sender` to send information to `receiver`.  
Our choice of channel selection depends on the situational demand

| Situation                            | Medium                      |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Immediate transmission of message    | `fax` instead of `letter`   |
| Immediate feedback                   | `phone` instead of `fax`    |
| Permanent record of message          | `written` instead of `oral` |
| degree of negotiation                | `Personal meeting`          |
| destination of message (a far place) | `letter`                    |
| nature of message (contract)         | `written`                   |

There can be 2, 3 or more `channels` involved simultaneously.

### Decoding

It is the act of understanding messages (words or symbols).  
When `receiver` receives the `message`, he receives 2 things.

1. Content
2. Context

#### Content

The actual `symbols` or `letters` of the `message` which is called the `language`.

#### Context

It is the way `message` was delivered and it is called `paralanguage`.  
This includes:

1. Tone of voice
2. Facial expressions
3. Emotional state
4. Gestures

### Feedback

This is a 2 way communication and tells the `sender` that the `receiver` has understood the `message`.

Following are the categories of `feedback`

#### Evaluation

Making a judgement about the `worth`, goodness of the `sender`'s statement.

#### Interpretation

`Paraphrasing` - Attempting to explain what the sender's statement meant.

#### Support

Attempting to assist or support the `sender`.

#### Probing

Attempting to gain additional information, continue the discussion or clarify the point.

#### Understanding

Attempting to discover completely what the `sender` meant by his statement.
