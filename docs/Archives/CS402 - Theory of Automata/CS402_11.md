# Lecture No. 11

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 26-10-2024</span>

Let's prove the _2nd_ statement of `kleene's theorem`.[^1]  
To prove that a `transition graph`[^2] can represent a `regular expression`,[^3] we will develop an `algorithm` which converts the `transition graph`[^2] into `generalized transition graph`[^4]  
The `transition graph`[^4] we want to convert is the following.  
![[CS402_i_11_1.png]]  

## Step 1

If a `transition graph`[^2] has more than one `initial states` then make _one_ `initial state`, connecting the old `initial states`.

## Step 2

Repeat the [step 1](#step-1) but for `final states`.

## Step 3

If there are 2 `states` connected with more than one `transition edges`, including the loops, convert these edges into one edge.

![[CS402_i_11_4.png]]  
this can be converted into  
![[CS402_i_11_5.png]]  
This works with any number of `transition edges`.

## Step 4

If 3 `states` are connected in a sequence, then we can skip the middle `state`.  
Connecting the first `state` with the last one with the `transition edge` labeled as the concatenation of the `regular expressions`[^3] of all the edges.

can be converted into

## Example

![[CS402_i_11_8.png]]  
Can be converted into  
![[CS402_i_11_9.png]]

## Example

![[CS402_i_11_10.png]]  
This can be converted into  
![[CS402_i_11_11.png]]  
Which can further be converted to  
![[CS402_i_11_12.png]]
