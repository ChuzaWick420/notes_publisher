## `Finite Automaton`[^1] With Output

There are machines which take an input and generate a `string`[^2] as output.  
These machines are called `machines with output` and there are two types.

### Moore Machine

It consists of following

- A finite `set`[^3] of `states` $q_0, q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_n$ where $q_0$ is the `initial state`.
- An `alphabet`[^2] of letters $\Sigma = \{a, b, c, \ldots\}$ from which the input `string`[^2] is formed.
- An `alphabet`[^2] of letters $\Gamma = \{x, y, z, \ldots\}$ from which the output `string`[^2] is formed.
- A transition table showing for each `state` and each input letter, what `state` is entered next.
- An output table showing what character is printed by each `state` as it is entered.

#### Example

$$\text{States}: q_0, q_1, q_2, q_3$$

$$\Sigma = \{a, b\}$$

$$\Gamma = \{0, 1\}$$

| Old States | New States after reading |       | <br>Characters to be printed |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ----- | ---------------------------- |
|            | $a$                      | $b$   |                              |
| $q_0$      | $q_1$                    | $q_3$ | $1$                          |
| $q_1$      | $q_3$                    | $q_1$ | $0$                          |
| $q_2$      | $q_0$                    | $q_3$ | $0$                          |
| $q_3$      | $q_3$                    | $q_2$ | $1$                          |

Now running the `string`[^2] $abbabbba$ over the machine will output $100010101$.

| Input  |       | a     | b     | b     | a     | b     | b     | b     | a     |
| ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| State  | $q_0$ | $q_1$ | $q_1$ | $q_1$ | $q_3$ | $q_2$ | $q_3$ | $q_2$ | $q_0$ |
| Output | $1$   | $0$   | $0$   | $0$   | $1$   | $0$   | $1$   | $0$   | $1$   |
