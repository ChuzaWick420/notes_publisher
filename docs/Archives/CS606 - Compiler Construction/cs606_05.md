## Lexical Analysis

The `scanner`[^1] converts the stream of characters into stream of `tokens`.[^1] This process is called `lexical analysis`.

## Tokens

A `token`[^1] is a syntactic category in a sentence of a language. The pair `<role, word>` is called the `token`.[^1]

### Example

Consider the English language sentence "He wrote the program".  

- `<Subject, He>`
- `<Verb, wrote>`
- `<Object, the program>`  

Similarly, for languages like `C`

```cpp
if (b == 0) a = b
```

- `<Keyword, if>`
- `<parenthesis, (>`
- `<variable, b>`
- `<bool operator, ==>`
- `<number, 0>`
- `<parenthesis, )>`
- `<variable, a>`
- `<assignment operator, =>`
- `<variable, b>`

## Ad Hoc Lexer

We can write a `lexer` in `c++` which reads from left to right and also reads a little bit ahead to determine where a `token`[^1] ends and where does a new `token`[^1] begins.

```cpp
class Lexer {
    Inputstream s;
    char next; // look ahead

    Lexer(Inputstream);
    Token nextToken();
    Token readID();
    bool idChar(char c);
    Token readNumber();
};

Lexer::Lexer(Inputstream _s) {
    s = _s;
    next = s.read();
}

Token Lexer::nextToken() {
    if (idChar(next))
        return readID();
    if (number(next))
        return readNumber();
    if (next == '"')
        return readString();
    // ...
}

Token Lexer::readID() {
    string id = "";

    while (true) {
        char c = input.read();

        if (idChar(c) == false)
            return new Token(TID, id);

        id = id + string(c);
    }
}

bool Lexer::idChar(char c) {

    if (isAlpha(c))
        return true;
    if (isDigit(c))
        return true;
    if (c == '_')
        return true;

    return false;
}

Token Lexer::readNumber () {

    string num = "";

    while (true) {

        next = input.read();

        if (!isNumber(next))
            return new Token(TNUM, num);

        num = num + string(next);
    }
}
```

This works _okay_ but there is a problem. We don't know what type of `token`[^1] is being read just by reading the first character.

- Reading `i`, does that mean it is a `variable` named `i` or a `keyword` such as `#!cpp if`?
- Reading `#!cpp =`, does that mean it is an `assignment operator` or `#!cpp ==` operator?  

This makes hand writing the `lexer` tedious therefore, the more principle approach is to _generate_ a `tokenizer` automatically.
