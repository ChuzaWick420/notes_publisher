## `NFA`[^1] â†’ `DFA`[^2] Construction

The algorithm is called the `subset construction`. The `transition table`[^3] of `NFA`[^1] contains multiple `states` meanwhile the `DFA`[^2] contains single `states`.  
Therefore, each `state` in `DFA`[^2] corresponds to multiple `states` in `NFA`.[^1]  

Following are the operations

- $\epsilon-closure(T)$ for `set`[^4] of `NFA`[^1] `states` reachable from some `NFA`[^1] `state` $s$ in $T$ on $\epsilon$ transitions alone.
- $move(T, a)$ for `set`[^4] of `NFA`[^1] `states` to which there is a transition on input $a$ from some `state` $s$ in `NFA`[^1] in $T$.

### Subset Construction

#### Algorithm

Input: 

- `NFA`[^1] $N$
- `states` `set`[^4] $S$
- Alphabet $\Sigma$
- State `state` $s_0$
- Final `state` $F$

Output:

- `DFA`[^1] $D$
- `states` `set`[^4] $S^\prime$
- Alphabet $\Sigma$
- State `state` $s_0^\prime = \epsilon-closure(s_0)$
- Final `state` $F^\prime$
- `Transition table`[^3] $S^\prime \times \Sigma ? S^\prime$

---

$S^\prime = \{s_0^\prime\}$ (unmarked)  
`#!cpp while`(there is some unmarked `state` in $T$ in $S^\prime$)  
	mark `state` $T$  
	`#!cpp for` all $a$ in $\Sigma$ `#!cpp do`  
		$U = \epsilon-enclosure(move(T, a))$  
		`#!cpp if` $U$ not already in $S^\prime$  
			add $U$ as unmarked state to $S^\prime Dtran(T, a) = U$  
		end `#!cpp if`  
	end `#!cpp for`  
end `#!cpp while`  
$F^\prime$:  
	for each `DFA`[^1] `state` $S$  
		`#!cpp if` $S$ contains an `NFA`[^1] final `state`  
			mark $S$ as `DFA`[^1] final state  
end algorithm

### Example

![[cs606_e_8_1.svg]]  
/// caption  
`NFA`[^1] for $(a | b)^*abb$ with $\Sigma = \{a, b\}$.  
///

The start `state` of `DFA`[^1] is $\epsilon-closure(0)$ which is $A = \{0, 1, 2, 4, 7\}$. These are the `states` which are reachable from $0$ through $\epsilon$ transitions.  
According to algorithm, mark $A$ and compute $\epsilon-enclosure(move(A, a))$.  
$move(A, a)$ is the `set`[^4] of `state` in `NFA`[^1] that have transitions on input $a$ from members of $A$.  

$$2 \to 3$$

$$7 \to 8$$

$$\epsilon-enclosure(move(A, a)) = \epsilon-enclosure(\{3, 8\}) = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8\}$$

Let  

$$B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8\}$$

Thus  

$$Dtran[A, a] = B$$

For input $b$,  

$$4 \to 5$$

$$C = \epsilon-closure(\{5\}) = \{1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$$

Let  

$$C = \{1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$$

Thus,  

$$Dtran[A, b] = C$$

We continue this process with unmarked sets $B$ and $C$ until all `sets`[^4] of `DFA`[^2] are marked.

1. $A=\{0,1,2,4,7\}$
2. $B=\{1,2,3,4,6,7,8\}$
3. $C=\{1,2,4,5,6,7\}$
4. $D=\{1,2,4,5,6,7,9\}$
5. $E=\{1,2,4,5,6,7,10\}$

$A$ is starting `state` as it contains $0$ and $E$ is the accepting `state` because it contains $10$.
