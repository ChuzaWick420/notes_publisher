# Lecture No. 11

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 17-03-2025</span>

## Semantic Analysis

Consider the English sentence "He wrote the computer". This sentence is syntactically correct but semantically wrong.  
Consider the following code example which is syntactically correct but has semantic errors

```cpp
int* foo(int i, int j) {
	for (k = 0; i < j; j++ )
		if(i < j - 2)
			sum = sum + i;
			
	return sum;
}
```

The errors are

- `Sum` was not declared
- `Function` is supposed to `#!cpp return` a `pointer`[^1] but returns an `#!cpp int`.

## Role of `Parser`[^2]

`Parsing` is the process of discovering a derivation for some sentence of a `language`.[^3]  
The mathematical model of a syntax is represented by a `grammer` $G$. The `language`[^3] generated by the `grammar` is indicated by $L(G)$. Syntax of most programming languages can be represented by `Context Free Grammar` (CFG).

The syntax of C, C++ and Java is derived heavily from `Algol-60`.  
The notation was developed by `John Backus` and adapted by `Peter Naur` for the `Algol-60` language report; thus the term `Backus-Naur Form (BNF)`.

There are 2 derivations of interest

- Left most where we replace the left most non terminal at each step.
- Right most where we replace the right most non terminal at each step.

Both these derivations produce different `parse trees`[^2] which implies different order of evaluations.
