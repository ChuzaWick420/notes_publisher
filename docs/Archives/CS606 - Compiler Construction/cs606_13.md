## Top down Parser

The `root node` is labeled as _goal_ which is the starting symbol of the `grammar`.  
The `top down parsing` algorithm is as follows:

1. Construct the `root node` of the `parse tree`.[^1]
2. Repeat until the fringe of the `parse tree`[^1] matches input `string`.[^2]
	1. At a `node` labeled $A$, select a production with $A$ on its left hand side.
	2. for each symbol on its right hand side, construct the appropriate child.
	3. When a terminal symbol is added to the fringe and it does not match the fringe, backtrack.

### Example

$$\text{input}= x - 2 * y$$

| P   | Sentential Form | Input         |
| --- | --------------- | ------------- |
| -   | Goal            | `x - 2 * y`   |
| 1   | expr            | `x - 2 * y`   |
| 2   | expr + term     | `x` - `2` * y |
| 4   | term + term     | `x` - `2` * y |
| 7   | factor + term   | `x` - `2` * y |
| 9   | <id, x> + term  | `x` - `2` * y |
| 9   | <id, x> + term  | `x` - `2` * y |

The `parser`[^2] made made the wrong choice of choosing `+` in step 2 and has to backtrack and use a different production.

| P   | Sentential Form | Input         |
| --- | --------------- | ------------- |
| -   | Goal            | `x - 2 * y`   |
| 1   | expr            | `x - 2 * y`   |
| 2   | expr - term     | `x` - `2` * y |
| 4   | term - term     | `x` - `2` * y |
| 7   | factor - term   | `x` - `2` * y |
| 9   | <id, x> - term  | `x` - `2` * y |
| 9   | <id, x> - term  | `x` - `2` * y |

Since the `-` match, let's continue

| P   | Sentential Form    | Input         |
| --- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| -   | <id, x> - term     | `x` - `2` * y |
| 7   | <id, x> - factor   | `x` - `2` * y |
| 9   | <id, x> - <num, 2> | `x` - `2` * y |
| -   | <id, x> - <num, 2> | `x` - `2` * y |

The `2` match but there is still `non terminals` in sentential form which need to be expanded, therefore we backtrack.

| P   | Sentential Form             | Input     |
| --- | --------------------------- | --------- |
| -   | <id, x> - term              | x - 2 * y |
| 5   | <id, x> - term * factor     | x - 2 * y |
| 7   | <id, x> - factor * factor   | x - 2 * y |
| 8   | <id, x> - <num, 2> * factor | x - 2 * y |
| -   | <id, x> - <num, 2> * factor | x - 2 * y |
| -   | <id, x> - <num, 2> * factor | x - 2 * y |
|     | <id, x> - <num, 2> *        |           |
| 9   | <id, y>                     | x - 2 * y |
|     | <id, x> - <num, 2> *        |           |
| -   | <id, y>                     | x - 2 * y |

## Left Recursion

| P   | Sentential Form | input     |
| --- | --------------- | --------- |
| -   | Goal            | x - 2 * y |
| 1   | expr            | x - 2 * y |
| 2   | expr + term     | x - 2 * y |
| 3   | expr + term + … | x - 2 * y |

`Top down parsers` cannot handle `left recursion grammars`.  
A `grammar` is left recursive if $\exists A \in NT$ such that a derivation $A \implies ^* A \alpha$ for some string $\alpha \in (NT \cup T)^*$.  
Consider the following  

$$A \to A \alpha$$

$$| \beta$$

We can re-write it as  

$$A \to \beta A$$

$$A^\prime \to \alpha A^\prime$$

$$| \epsilon$$

```
expr  ->   term expr'
expr' -> + term expr'
      |  - term expr'

term  ->   factor term'
term' -> * factor term'
      |  / factor
      |    term'
	  |    e
```

These fragments use only `right recursion`.  
They retain the original `left associativity`.  
A `top-down parser` will terminate using them.

## Predictive Parsing

Instead of backtracking, we can _look ahead_ in arbitrary amount to provide enough context to pick the correct production.  
Given $A \to \alpha | \beta$, the `parser`[^3] should be able to choose between $\alpha$ and $\beta$.  
To accomplish this, the parser needs `FIRST` and `FOLLOW` `sets`[^4]

### First `Sets`[^4]

For some right hand side $\alpha \in G$ defines FIRST($\alpha$) as `set`[^4] of `tokens`[^5] that appear as the first symbol in some `string`[^2] derived from $\alpha$.  

$$x \in FIRST(\alpha) \iff \alpha \implies ^*x \gamma$$

For some $\gamma$.
