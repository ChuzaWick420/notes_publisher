# 03. Serial Vs Parallel Computing

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 05-12-2025</span>

## Serial Computing

Serial computing is a type of processing in which one task is completed at a time and all the tasks are executed by the processor in a sequence.

## Parallel Computing

Parallel computing is a type of computing architecture in which several processors simultaneously execute multiple, smaller calculations broken down from an overall larger, complex problem.

| Serial Computing                     | Parallel Computing                       |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Are uniprocessor systems.            | Are multiprocessor systems.               |
| Can execute one instruction at a time. | Can execute multiple instructions at a time. |
| Speed is limited.                    | No limitation on speed.                   |
| Lower performance.                   | Higher performance.                       |
