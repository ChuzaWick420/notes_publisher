# 04. Intro to Parallel Computing

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 05-12-2025</span>

Parallel Computing is the simultaneous execution of the same task (split up and adapted) on multiple processors in order to obtain faster results.

It is a kind of computing architecture where the large problems break into independent, smaller, usually similar parts that can be processed in one go. It is done by multiple CPUs communicating via shared memory, which combines results upon completion. It helps in performing large computations as it divides the large problem between more than one processor.

## Usage

- HPC: High Performance/Productivity Computing  
- Technical Computing  
- Cluster computing

The term parallel computing architecture sometimes used for a computer with more than one processor available for processing.

The recent multicore processor (chips with more than one processor core) are some commercial examples which bring parallel computing to the desktop.

## Multi Processor

More than one CPU works together to carry out computer instructions or programs.

## Multi Core

Is a microprocessor on a single integrated circuit with two or more separate processing units, called cores, each of which reads and executes program instructions.
