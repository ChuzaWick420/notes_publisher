Adding UI design to the #software-requirements-specification document is controversial.  
One mistake that is commonly done is that UI defines the #functional-requirements.  
When the requirements are unstable, it means the UI has to be changed accordingly, which means a lot of rework.

# Motives

Users usually judge a software product by its GUI.  
If it is not good then it will lead to user not using the product at all.

# Pitfalls

It can distract us from focusing on the business problems to how to do it.  
Unstable requirements means a lot of changes in the GUI.

# Prototypes

These are used to decrease user dissatisfaction.  
These are not the actual products but a tangible copy of the product which lacks functionalities but the user can play around with it rather than reading the #software-requirements-specification document.
