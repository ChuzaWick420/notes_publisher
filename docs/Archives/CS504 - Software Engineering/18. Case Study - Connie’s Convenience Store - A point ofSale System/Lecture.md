2. Keep the overall goal, critical success factor, always in front of you.
3. "To support, to help, to facilitate".

### Connie's Wish List

2. know whether an item is on sale
3. automatically total the sale and calculate tax
4. handle purchases and returns
5. handle payments with cash, check, or charge
6. authorize checks and cards
7. calculate change when working with cash or checks
8. record all of the information about a customer transaction
9. balance the cash in the drawer with the amount recorded by the point-of-sale system.

### Why?
1. speed up checkout time
2. reduce the number of pricing errors
3. reduce the labor required to ticket the item with a price, originally and when
