The information moves from one place to another.  
When it is moved, certain actions are performed over it.  
This movement is controlled by a set of rules.  
These are documented easily through the state transition diagram.

## External Inputs
These are elementary processes come from outside the system to process or control information and may alter the system. It's primary intent is to maintain ILFs (Internal Logic Files).

## External Outputs
These are the elementary processes which send information outside of the application boundary.  
Their primary intend is to present the information to the user.  
The processing logic must contain at least one mathematical structure or should create derived data.  
They can also maintain ILFs.

## External Inquiry
It also sends data outside the application boundary and presents data to the user derived from the ILFs.  
It doesn't contain any mathematical formulas.
