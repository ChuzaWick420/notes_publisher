# Tangent Lines and Rate of Change
![[Pasted image 20240816164907.png]]

The `secent` line is the one which connects $\overline{PQ}$.  
The $m_{sec}$ is the `slope`[^1]  
As the $x_1 - x_0 \to 0$ 

- The `secent` line approaches the `tangent`line if $x_1$ moves from _right_ to $x_0$.
- The `tangent` line approaches the `secent`line if $x_0$ moves from _left_ to $x_1$.

Therefore, the `slope`[^1] of `tangent` line is given by  

$$m_{tan} = \lim_{x_1 \rightarrow x_0} \frac{f(x_1) - f(x_0)}{x_1 - x_0}$$

## Average Velocity
![[Pasted image 20240816170508.png]]  
The `distance` is defined to be a `function`[^2] of `time`.  
Since we are taking the snapshots from a very large gap in `time`, we say this is `average` not `instantaneous` rate of change.  

$$Average = \frac{f(t_1) - f(t_0)}{t_1 - t_0}$$

## Instantaneous Velocity

$$instantaneous =\lim_{t_1 \rightarrow t_0} \frac{f(t_1) - f(t_0)}{t_1 - t_0}$$
