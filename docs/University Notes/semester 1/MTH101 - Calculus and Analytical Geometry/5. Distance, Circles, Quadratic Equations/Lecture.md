# Distance Formula
![[Pasted image 20240812144155.png]]

Notice how there is a `triangle`?  
We can find the distance between `A`and `B` by using `Pythagorus thoerem`.  

$$(hyp)^2 = (perp)^2 + (base)^2$$

$$hyp = \sqrt{(perp)^2 + (base)^2}$$

$$distance = \sqrt{(\Delta y)^2 + (\Delta x)^2}$$

$$distance = \sqrt{(y_2 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - x_1)^2}$$

# Midpoint
The midpoint of $\overline{AB}$ is defined to be $average$ of the coordinate values relative to $axes$.

# Circle
A `circle` is defined to be a set of points which are equidistant from a certain point.  

$$\{(x, y): r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\}$$

## General Form

$$ax^2 + by^2 + dx + ey + f = 0$$

### Example
Find `radius` and `center` of the circle $x^2 + y^2 - 8x + 2y + 8 = 0$ 

$$x^2 + y^2 - 8x + 2y + 8 = 0$$

$$(x^2 - 8x) + (y^2 + 2y) = -8$$

$$(x^2 - 8x + 16) + (y^2 + 2y + 1) = -8 + 16 + 1$$

$$(x - 4)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 9$$

$$(x - 4)^2 + (y - (-1))^2 = 3^2$$

So the `radius` is `3` and the center is `(4, -1)`

# Parabola
![[Pasted image 20240812165943.png]]

This `parabola` can be represented by equation:  

$$y = (x - 2) \cdot (x - 5)$$

Notice how $y$ becomes `0` if either of the terms become `0` and for that, we need `x` to be equal to either `2` or `5`.  
Let us try to simplify it  

$$y = x \cdot (x - 5) - 2 \cdot (x - 5)$$

$$y = x^2 - 5x - 2x + 2 \cdot 5$$

$$y = x^2 - x(5 + 2) + 2 \cdot 5$$

$$y = x^2 - Sx + P$$

Where `S` is `sum of the roots` and `P` is `product of the roots`.

## General Equation

$$y = ax^2 + bx + c$$

Notice the resemblance?  
For the `roots`, equation takes form of  

$$0 = x^2 + \frac{b}{a} \cdot x + \frac{c}{a}$$

Where $-\frac{b}{a} = sum$ and $\frac{c}{a} = product$

### Vertex
The `tip` of the `parabola` is called its `vertex` and it exists in middle of the `roots`  

$$middle = \frac{sum}{2}$$

The `x-coordinate` will be  

$$x = - \frac{b}{2a}$$

And we can get the `y-coordinate` just by putting this in $y = f(x)$
