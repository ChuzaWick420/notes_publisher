# Plane

![[Pasted image 20240811005420.png]]

$b$ is called the `y-coordinate` or `ordinate` and $a$ is called the `x-coordinate` or `abscissa`.

## Quadrants
The `plane` can be divided into _4_ `quadrants`.

## Graphs
The `order pairs` which satisfy the equation $y = x^2$ make a graph collectively.

# Intercepts
These are the points where `graphs` intersect the `axes` of the `coordinate plane`.

> [!NOTE] A graph is made from `2` quantities or `variables`. So to find the intercept with respect to one `variable`, we assume the other one to be `0`.

## Example

$$3x + 2y = 6$$

### $x$ Intercept

$$3x + 2(0) = 6$$

$$x = \frac{6}{3} = 2$$

### $y$ Intercept

$$3(0) + 2y = 6$$

$$2y = 6$$

$$y = \frac{6}{2} = 3$$

# Symmetricity
The `axes` themselves act like a _mirror_.  
The numbers $(a, b)$ and $(-a, b)$ are symmetric about `y-axis`.  
This simplifies the sketching of `graphs`.

## Example

$$x = |y|$$

This yields 2 possibilities. $x = y$ and $x = -y$.  
Notice how $x$ never changes, hence the `graph` is symmetric about `x-axis`  
Now if we plot one of them, say $x = y$

Similarly, for the $x = -y$, we can just _reflect_ it.
