# 33. Applications of `Definite Integrals`[^1]

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 30-10-2024</span>

## Area between 2 Curves

Let there be 2 `functions`[^2] $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ defined over the `interval`[^3] $[a, b]$ such that $f(x) \ge g(x)$.

Let $A_1$ be `area` under $f(x)$ and $A_2$ be `area` under $g(x)$ then $A$, being the `area` _between_ them can be found out by  

$$A = A_1 - A_2$$

$$A=\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx-\int_{a}^{b}g(x)dx=\int_{a}^{b}(f(x)-g(x))dx$$

It is possible that one of the `functions`[^2] is under the `x axis`. Then in that case, we translate both `functions`[^2] above the `x axis` by some `constant` value $m$.

$$A=\int_{a}^{b}(f(x)+m)dx-\int_{a}^{b}(g(x)+m)dx=\int_{a}^{b}(f(x)-g(x))dx$$

This definition also applies if we replace $x$ with $y$.
