# 38. Work and `Definite integral`[^1]

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 30-10-2024</span>

## Work Done by a Constant Force

If a body is moved unit `distance` $d$ by a `force` $\vec{F}$ in $x^+$ direction then `work` done on the body can be found out by  

$$W = \vec{F} \cdot d$$

### Units

#### Distance

- `meter` $m$

#### Force

- `newton` $N$
- `pounds` $lb$
- `dynes` (the `force` required to accelerate a `1 gram` body by $\frac{1 cm}{s^2}$)

#### Work

- `newton meter` (also called `joule` $j$) $N m$
- `foot pounds` $ft \, lb$
- `dyne centi meters` $dyne \, cm$

## Work Done by a Variable Force

Imagine a body moving in $x^+$ direction by a `force` which is dependent on the `distance` $x$ in `interval`[^2] $[a, b]$ then the find the `work` done on the body.  
The `work` done at any instance would be  

$$W_i = F(x_i^*)\Delta x_i$$

The `work` done across the whole `interval`[^2] would be  

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n}W_{i}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}F(x_{i}^{*})\Delta x_{i}$$

And for more accuracy  

$$W=\lim_{\max(\Delta x_{i}\to 0)}\sum_{i=1}^{n}F(x_{i}^{*})\Delta x_{i}=\int_{a}^{b}F(x)dx$$

## Pressure

It is defined as `force` per unit `area`.  

$$P = \frac{force}{area} = \rho \, h$$

Where $\rho$ is the `density` and $h$ is the `depth`.

### Fluid Pressure

If a flat surface is submerged in a fluid at certain `depth` $h$ then the `pressure` on that surface would be  

$$F = \rho \cdot h \cdot A$$

The shape of the container is irrelevant.

### Pascal's Principle

The fluid `pressure` at a given `height` is same in all the directions.

The formula for `fluid pressure` on a surface would be  

$$F = \int_{a}^{b} \rho h(x) w(x) dx$$
