# Graphs of Functions
Imagine a `function`[^1]  

$$f(x) = y = x + 2; x\ne 2$$

One way to graph is to find the `intercepts`.

## `x intercept`

$$0 = x + 2$$

$$-2 = x$$

## `y intercept`

$$y = 0 + 2$$

$$y = 2$$

Then, we can combine both points and get our `line`[^2].  
Its graph will be

## Translations
1. $f(x) + c$ translates the `graph` $c$ units _up_.
2. $f(x) - c$ translates the `graph` $c$ units _down_.
3. $f(x + c)$ translates the `graph` $c$ units _left_.
4. $f(x - c)$ translates the `graph` $c$ units _right.

## Scaling
If a `function`[^1] is multiplied by a `constant` $c$ , such that $c \cdot f(x)$ then $c$ is the _vertical scaling factor_ of $f(x)$.

## Vertical Line Test
We can check if a graph is of a `function`[^1] by drawing a _vertical line_ of the form $x = a$.  
If this line intersects the graph at only _one point_ then it is graph of a `function`[^1].
