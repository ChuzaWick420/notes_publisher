# Definite Integral

Previously, we sliced the `area` into `rectangles` with _equal_ `widths`. Was it mandatory? no.  
Now we will slice them into `rectangles` with `width` that are _not equal_ in length.

These slices or `subintervals` are also called `partitians` of the `interval`[^1] and the biggest one is called the `mesh size`, denoted as $max(\Delta x_i)$.

Here is the important part, if $max(\Delta x_i) \to 0$ then every $\Delta x \to 0$.  

$$A = \lim_{max(\Delta x_i) \to 0} \sum_{i = 1}^{n}f(x_i) \cdot \Delta x_i$$

## Definite Integral of `Continuous Function`[^2] with Non-negative Values

$$\int_a^b f(x)dx = \lim_{max(\Delta x_i) \to 0} \sum_{i = 1}^{n}f(x_i) \cdot \Delta x_i$$

This left side is called `definite integral` with $a$ being its `lower limit` and $b$ being its `upper limit`.  

This term $\sum_{i = 1}^{n}f(x_i) \cdot \Delta x_i$ is called `Riemann Sum`.

### Example

![[Pasted.png]]  
This `area` can be found out using:  

$$\int_1^2 x \cdot dx$$

## Definite Integral of `Continuous Function`[^2]

The _net signed_ `area` of a `continuous function`[^2] defined over the `interval`[^1] $(a, b)$ is also found out by  

$$\int_a^b f(x) \cdot dx$$

![[Pasted image 20240926183728.png]]  
This is the $\sin(x)$ `function`.[^3]  
Let us say that the `area` of the blue section is $c$ then the `area` of the green section will be $-c$ (due to symmetric reasons).  
Hence, the _net area_ is $0$!  

$$\int_0^{2 \pi} \sin(x) \cdot dx = 0$$

## Properties of Definite Integrals

- $$\int_a^b f(x) \cdot dx = - \int_b^a f(x) \cdot dx$$

- $$\int_a^b c f(x) \cdot dx = c \int_a^b f(x) \cdot dx$$

- $$\int_a^b (f(x) + g(x)) \cdot dx = \int_a^b f(x) \cdot dx + \int_a^b g(x) \cdot dx$$

- $$\int_a^b (f(x) - g(x)) \cdot dx = \int_a^b f(x) \cdot dx - \int_a^b g(x) \cdot dx$$

- If $a < c < b$ then $$\int_a^b f(x) \cdot dx = \int_a^c f(x) \cdot dx + \int_c^b f(x) \cdot dx$$

## Theorems

1. If $f(x)$ is `integrable` on the `interval`[^1] $[a, b]$ and $f(x) \ge 0$ for all $x$ in $[a, b]$ then $$\int_a^bf(x) \cdot dx \ge 0$$

2. if $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are `integrable` on the `interval`[^1] $[a, b]$ and $f(x) \ge g(x)$ for all $x$ in $[a, b]$ then $$\int_a^bf(x) \cdot dx \ge \int_a^b g(x) \cdot dx$$

3. If $f(x)$ is a `continous function`[^2] bound by $[a, b]$ then $f(x)$ is `integrable` on $[a, b]$
4. If $f(x)$ is a `function`[^3] bound by $[a, b]$ with points of `discontinuity`[^3] then $f(x)$ is `integrable` on $[a, b]$.
5. If $f(x)$ _not_ bound by $[a, b]$ then $f(x)$ is _not_ `integrable` on $[a, b]$
