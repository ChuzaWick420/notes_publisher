# Chain Rule

`Chain Rule` is used for differentiation of `composite functions`.  
Say, we have a `function`[^1] `y` such that  

$$y = (f o g)(x) = f\left(g(x)\right)$$

Then assume, $g(x) = u$ then $(fog)(x)$ takes the form $f(u)$.  
Then we have:  

$$\frac{dy}{du} = f^{'}(u)$$

$$\frac{du}{dx} = g^{'}(x)$$

Hence, the rule itself is defined as:  

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx} = f^{'}(u) \cdot g^{'}(x)$$
