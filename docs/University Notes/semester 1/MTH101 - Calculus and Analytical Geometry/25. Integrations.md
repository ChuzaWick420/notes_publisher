# Integration

## The Area Problem

### The Problem

Given a `continous function`[^1] $f(x)$ defined over an `interval`[^2] $[a, b]$, find area between the `x-axis` and the `graph` of the `function`.[^3]

### Solution

Let's first define the `area` to be a `function`[^3] of $x$ where $x$ is the distance from $a$ and $a \le x \le b$.  
To know what this `area` looks like, Newton and Leibniz suggested to find  

$$A^{\prime}(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{A(x + h) - A(x)}{h}$$

Here $x$ is an arbitrary number with $h$ being an arbitrary addition to it.  
The difference $A(x + h) - A(x)$ can be thought of as:

The `area` of this slice can be approximated by computing the `area` of a `rectangle` whose `base` is $h$ and whose `height` is $f(c)$ where $c$ is the `midpoint` between $x$ and $(x + h)$.

From the visualization, as the $h \to 0$, $c \to x$.  

$$A^{\prime}(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{A(x + h) - A(x)}{h} \approx \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(c) \cdot h}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} f(c) = f(x)$$

## Integrations (Anti-Derivatives)

A `function`[^3] $F(x)$ is called `anti-derivative` of $f(x)$ on a given `interval`[^2] if $F^{\prime}(x) = f(x)$ for all values of $x$ within that `interval`.[^2]

### Example

Imagine few `functions`[^3] such as:  

$$f(x) = x^2$$

$$g(x) = x^2 - 3$$

$$h(x) = x^2 \pm c; c \in \mathbb{R}$$

Then

$$f^{\prime}(x) = g^{\prime}(x) = h^{\prime}(x) = 2x$$

Hence, the more generalized `anti-derivative` is $F(x) \pm C$ or more simply, just $F(x) + C$ where $C \in \mathbb{R}$.

## Indefinite Integral

If we have $\frac{d}{dx} \left(F(x) + C\right) = f(x)$ then,  

$$d \left(F(x) + C\right) = f(x) \cdot dx$$

$$F(x) + C = \int f(x) \cdot dx$$

> $\int$ and $d$ annihilate each other.

The $\int$ is called the `integral symbol` and the $f(x)$ in this case is called the `integrand`.

## Properties of Indefinite Integral

- $$\int c f(x) \, dx = c \int f(x) \, dx$$

- $$\int \left(f(x) + g(x)\right) dx = \int f(x) dx + \int g(x) dx$$

- $$\int \left(f(x) - g(x)\right) dx = \int f(x) dx - \int g(x) dx$$
