# Lines

If we have 2 points $A(x_1, y_1)$ and $B(x_2, y_2)$ then a `line` is an object which connects both of these points.  
This object has no width or curvature and can also be imagined as a `set`[^1] of points.

## Slopes

![[Pasted image 20240812131250.png]]

If $\overline{AB}$ is a `line` then, its `slope` $m$ is defined to be the `ratio` from `rise` to `run`.  

$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac {\Delta y}{\Delta x}$$

## Angle of Inclination

From the [slope](#slopes), we can fine the `angle of inclination` by using $\tan^{-1}{(m)}$.  

$$\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{perp}}{\text{base}}$$

$$\tan(\theta) = \frac {\Delta y}{\Delta x}$$

$$\tan (\theta) = m$$

$$\theta = \tan^{-1} (m)$$

## Parallel and Perpendicular Lines

### Parallel

For _parallel_ [lines](#lines) if $m_1$ and $m_2$ are [slopes](#slopes) of each [lines](#lines) then

$$m_1 = m_2$$

### Perpendicular

For _perpendicular_ [lines](#lines).  

$$m_1 = \frac{-1}{m_2}$$

To prove  

$$\tan(\theta_1) \cdot \tan(\theta_2) = -1$$

$$\because \theta_2 = \theta_2 + 90^{\circ}$$

$$\tan(\theta_1) \cdot \tan(\theta_1 + 90^\circ) = -1$$

$$\tan(\theta_1) \cdot - \cot(\theta_1 ) = -1$$

The `-` sign comes from the fact that `rise` is in $y^+$ and `run` is in $x^-$ .  

$$\because \cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan{\theta}}$$

$$\tan(\theta_1) \cdot \frac{-1}{\tan(\theta_1 )} = -1$$

$$-1 = -1$$

## Equations of Lines

### Lines Parallel to Coordinate Axes

#### `x-axis`

![[Pasted image 20240812135906.png]]

More generally,  

$$x = a$$

 Where $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ .

#### `y-axis`

If we take $y$ in terms of `function`[^2] then notice how it does not depend on $x$, hence it is `constant`.

More generally,  

$$y = a$$

Where $a \in \mathbb{Z}$.

### Slope - point Form

if we are given [slope](#slopes) of a [line](#lines) along with a single point $P(x_1, y_1)$ which lies on that [line](#lines) then we can construct the equation for it.  

$$m = \frac{y - y_1}{x - x_1}$$

$$y - y_1 = m \cdot (x - x_1)$$

Here, the $P(x, y)$ is any arbitrary point.

### Slope - Intercept Form

#### Relative to `x-axis`

If we have an `x intercept` called $a$ then the previous equation takes form of  

$$y - 0 = m \cdot (x - a)$$

#### Relative to `y-axis`

If we have an `y intercept` called $b$ then the previous equation takes form of  

$$y - b = m \cdot (x - 0)$$

### General Equation

$$ax + by + c = 0$$

Where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are `constants`.  
This equation is called `first degree` equation.
