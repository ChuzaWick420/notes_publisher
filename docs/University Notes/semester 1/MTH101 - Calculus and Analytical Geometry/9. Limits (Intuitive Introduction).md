# Limits(Intuitive Introduction)

## Tangent Problem

![[Pasted image 20240814164829.png]]  
Given a `graph` and a `point`, find `tangent` to the `graph` at that `point`.

The problem gave rise to `differential calculus`.

## Area Problem

![[Pasted image 20240814165139.png]]  
Given a `graph`, find area under it in `interval`[^1] $[a, b]$.  
This problem gave rise to `integral calculus`.

## Area as a Limit

We can find the area under a `curve` by dividing it into smaller and smaller `rectangles`.  
And then taking the _sum_ of the `area` of these `rectangles`, we get our `area`.

## Limits

Imagine a `function`[^2]

$$f(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x}$$

Notice how it is `undefined` at $x = 0$.  
This is where the `Limit` comes into play.  

$$\frac{\sin(x)}{x} = undefined$$

To check if a `limit` exists, meaning _what_ does the `function`[^2] approaches, we check from both _left_ and _right_ directions on the `x-axis`.

### From Right

What does the `function`[^2] approaches as $x$ approach to `0` from right direction.  

$$\lim_{x \rightarrow 0^+}\frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1$$

### From Left

What does the `function`[^2] approaches as $x$ approach to `0` from left direction.  

$$\lim_{x \rightarrow 0^-}\frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1$$

Therefore, to check the _existence_ of `lim`, 

$$\lim_{x \rightarrow 0^-}\frac{\sin(x)}{x} = \lim_{x \rightarrow 0^+}\frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1$$
