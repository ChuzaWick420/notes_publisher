# Formal Definition
For any number $\epsilon > 0$ , if we can find an interval $(x_0, x_1)$ containing a point $a$ such that such that

$$L - \epsilon < f(x) < L + \epsilon$$

for all $x \in (x_0, x_1)$ except possibly $x = a$ then,  

$$\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = L$$

So, $f(x)$ exists in the interval $(L - \epsilon, L + \epsilon)$  
The $\epsilon$ is a very small number. Here is an example  

$$\frac{1}{10^{10^{100}}}$$

This below part of `fraction` is called `Googolplex`.
