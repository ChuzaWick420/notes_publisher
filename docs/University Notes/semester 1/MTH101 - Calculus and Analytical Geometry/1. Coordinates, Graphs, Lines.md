# Coordinates, Graphs and Lines

## What is Calculus?

Study of rate of change of one quantity with respect to other quantity.

## Pictorial Summary of Hierarchy of Real Numbers

![[Pasted image 20240810184459.png]]  
Here, the following `sets`[^1] are represented:

- $\mathbb{C}$ for `complex numbers`.
- $\mathbb{R}$ for `real numbers`.
- $\mathbb{Q}$ for `rational numbers`.
- $\mathbb{Q}^{\prime}$ for `irrational numbers`.
- $\mathbb{Z}$ for `integers numbers`.
- $\mathbb{N}$ for `natural numbers`.

## Coordinate line

This is just a convention.

Let's say, we define a `unit` of `length` as `r`.

## Order Properties

When we compare 2 _distinct_ numbers, one of them is going to be either $>$ or $<$.

## Inequalities

They can contain multiple possibilities. Here's an example:  

$$2 \le 6$$

This `inequality` consists of `2` possibilities.

$$2 < 6$$

$$2 = 6$$

Since the first one is `true` so the `inequality` itself is `true`.

### Theorems

$$a < b \land b < c \implies a < c$$

$$a < b \implies a + c < b + c \implies a - c < b - c$$

$$a < b \implies ac < bc \text{ where } c > 0$$

$$a < b \implies ac > bc \text{ where } c < 0$$

$$a < b \land c < d \implies a + c < b + d$$

$$a < b \implies \frac{1}{a} > \frac{1}{b}$$

## Intervals

We can define them as `sets`[^1] in the following way:  

- For `closed intervals`:

$$[a, b]=\{x:a \le x \le b\}$$

- For `open intervals`:

$$(a, b)=\{x:a < x < b\}$$

Geometrically, we can show it as:

Here, the _red line_ represents the whole `set`[^1] of values which are `elements` of the `interval` we have defined.

## Solving Inequalities

Take for example:  

$$3 + 7x \le 2x - 9$$

Then we apply the [theorems of inequalities](#theorems) on it.  

$$3 - 3 + 7x \le 2x - 9 - 3$$

$$7x \le 2x - 12$$

$$7x - 2x \le 2x - 2x - 12$$

$$5x \le - 12$$

$$\frac{1}{5} \cdot 5x \le - 12 \cdot \frac{1}{5}$$

$$x \le \frac{-12}{5}$$
