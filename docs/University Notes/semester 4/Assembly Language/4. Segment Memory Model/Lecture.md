# Rationale
The `8080` and `8085` both are linear models (meaning, an array) but due to 16-bit `address bus`, it can only target `2^16 = 64k` memory locations.  
Then #segmented-memory-model (used by `8085`) was introduced to extend this limit.

There are `3` sections of program.
1. Code
2. Data
3. Programâ€™s Stack  
These `3` sections are not distinguishable in the `linear model` but they _are_ in #segmented-memory-model.

# Mechanism
There are multiple windows, each for a specific section.  
The memory size of `8088` is `1MB` which can be addressed by 20-bit address bus.  
These memory windows are assigned to each segment.  
`extra segment` can be used when we need to access `2` different areas of memory but cannot be accessed from same window (meaning, both areas are from separate windows).  
It can be used as an extra `data segment`.

Segment #register tells where to open the _window_ of size 64KB.  
The `Base` and `offset` are used as variables.  
The segment tells the `base` meanwhile `offset` is added to it.

The #instruction-pointer cannot work alone.  
Firstly, a _window_ of 64KB is opened by `code segment` #register which stores the `base`.  
The #instruction-pointer uses this base as a reference of starting and then moves using the `offsets`.  
Since it is 16-bit in itself as well, it cannot move outside that `64Kb` window.  
When the CS #register changes the base, the window is moved and #instruction-pointer also behaves relatively.

# Physical Address Calculator
The `code segment` #register and `offset` both are 16-bit in size.  
However, we need 20-bit address to address `1MB` memory.  
There should be a way for both of these `16-bit` registers to make up a `20-bit` address.

![[Pasted image 20240521170745.png]]  
The `code segment` gets 4 `zeros` appended to the right.  
The `offset` gets 4 `zeros` appended to the left.  
Then these are added together.  
![[Pasted image 20240521171002.png]]  
There _maybe_ a `carry` bit which gets generated but it is not stored.  
This whole phenomena is called `address wraparound`.

# Paragraph Boundaries
The `segment` value itself is a 16-bit number in a 20-bit physical address.  
This 16-bit boundary is called `paragraph boundaries`.

# Overlapping Segments
Segments can also overlap.  
Means if the `CS`, `DS`, `SS` and `ES` all have the same values, they (segments or windows) all are overlapping.

The partially overlapping segments can also point to the same exact physical memory location.  
Consider this example:  
![[Pasted image 20240521180939.png]]  
The segment pointed by `CS` #register is `1DDD:0100`.  
Where `1DDD` is the `base` of the `code segment` and `0100` is the `offset`.  
Then we append `4` bits (1 `hex` digit) for addition (to figure out the physical address).  
The result of that addition is `1DED0`.

Now, we can also open a segment pointed by `DS` #register at `1DED` with `offset` `0000` which when added, results into `1DED0`.

Hence this proves that even the partially overlapping segments can point to same memory address.

This pair of `segment:offset` is called #logical-address.
