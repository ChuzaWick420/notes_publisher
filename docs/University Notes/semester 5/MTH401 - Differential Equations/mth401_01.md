# 01. Introduction

## Background

### Linear Equations

$$y = mx + c$$

### Quadratic Equations

$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$

### Cubic Equations

$$ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0$$

## System of Linear Equations

$$ax + by + c = 0$$

$$lx + my + c = 0$$

## Differential Operator

$$\frac {dy}{dx} = \frac 1 x$$

Taking `anti derivative`[^1] on both sides

$$y = \ln (x)$$
