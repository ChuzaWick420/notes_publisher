# Lecture No. 9

![[Pasted image 20241026135801.png]]

Consider the `string`[^1] $abbbabbbabba$.  
When you trace the `string`[^1] on the given `transition graph`,[^2] you will find 3 successful paths.  
Hence the `string`[^1] is accepted by the `transition graphs`[^2]

## Generalized Transition Graphs

These are collection of followings:

- Finite number of `states` with one being `initial state` and many or none being `final states`.
- Finite `set`[^3] of input `letters` from which `strings`[^1] can be constructed.
- Directed edges connecting some pair of states labeled with `regular expression`[^4]
