# Lecture No. 4

Imagine we have $\Sigma = \{a, b\}$ then a `language` $L$ having even number of $a$ and $b$ can be defined as  

$$(aa + bb + (ab + ba) (aa + bb)^*(ab + ba))^*$$

## Note

1. $$r_1 = a^* + b^*$$

2. $$r_2 = (a + b)^*$$

The $r_1$ does not generate any concatenation of $a$ and $b$ meanwhile $r_2$ does.

## Equivalent Regular Expressions

Two `regular expressions`[^1] are called `equivalent` if both of them produce the same `language`.

### Example

$$r_1 = (a + b)^*(aa + bb)$$

$$r_2 = (a + b)^*aa + (a + b)^*bb$$

Both define a `language` consisting of `strings`[^2] ending with either $aa$ or $bb$.

## Regular Languages

The `language` generated by any `regular expression`[^1] is called `regular language`.

### Note

If $L_1$ and $L_2$ are generated by $r_1$ and $r_2$ then following are true:

1. $r_1 + r_2 \to L_1 + L_2$ or $L_1 \cup L_2$
2. $r_1r_2 \to L_1L_2$ such that each `string`[^2] of $L_1$ is prefixed by every `string`[^2] of $L_2$
3. $r_1^* \to L_1^*$ such that the `strings`[^2] are concatenated by the `strings`[^2] of $L$, including $\Lambda$

> NOTE: All finite `languages` are `regular`.

## Finite Automaton

Imagine a game board with 64 boxes.  
Then there are 64 or less pieces of paper which are colored either white or black.  
The number of arrangements in which these pieces of paper can be placed in the boxes is finite.  
To start the game, one of the arrangement needs to be initialized.  
There is a pair of dices which can generate numbers from 2 to 12.  
Each number is associated with a possible arrangement.  
One or more arrangements can be considered as winning.  
Winning of the game depends on the sequence in which the numbers are generated.  
This structure of the game can be considered to be a `finite automaton`.

### Another Definition

It is a collection of following:

- Finite number of `states`, one being initial and possibly other being a final one.  
- Finite `set`[^3] of input letters from which input strings are formed.
- Finite `set`[^3] of transitions of `states`.

#### Example

$$\Sigma = \{a, b\}$$

##### States

$x$, $y$, $z$ where $x$ is `initial state` and $z$ is `final state`.

##### Transitions

- At state $x$ reading `a`, go to state $z$.
- At state $x$ reading `b`, go to state $y$.
- At state $y$ reading `a`, `b`, go to state $y$.
- At state $z$ reading `a`, `b`, go to state $z$.

#### Transition Table

| Old States | New States  |             |
| ---------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|            | Reading `a` | Reading `b` |
| `x -`      | `z`         | `y`         |
| `y`        | `y`         | `y`         |
| `z +`      | `z`         | `z`         |

This `language` can be represented as $a(a + b)^*$.
