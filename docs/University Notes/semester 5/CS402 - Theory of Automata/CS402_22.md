## Applications of Incrementing and Complementing Machines

### Incrementing Machine

It can be used to make a `machine` capable of doing `binary addition`.

### Complementing Machine

It can be used to make a `machine` capable of doing `binary subtraction`.

## Subtracting a Binary Number from Another

### Method

Imagine we need to subtract $b$ from $a$.  
Following are the steps to do so

1. Take 1's complement of $b$.
2. Add it to $a$.
3. Increment the final result by $1$.

Also, ignore any overflows which may happen.

### Example

$$a = 1110$$

$$b = 0101$$

Taking 1's complement.  

$$b^\prime = 1010$$

Adding it to $a$.  

$$a + b^\prime = 1110 + 1010 = 11000$$

Incrementing by $1$.  

$$11000 \rightarrow 11001$$

Ignoring the overflow  

$$a - b = a + b^\prime = 1001$$

## Equivalent Machines

Two `machines` are called equivalent if they output same `string`[^1] when same input `string`[^1] is passed through them.

## Theorem

### Statement

For every `moore machine`,[^2] there is an equivalent `mealy machine`[^3] if we ignore the extra character printed by `moore machine`[^2]

### Proof

Let $M$ be a `moore machine`[^2] then shifting the output characters corresponding to each `state` to the labels of corresponding incoming `transitions`, results into an equivalent `mealy machine`.[^3]

### Note

While converting `moore machine`[^2] into an equivalent `mealy machine`,[^3] the output character of a `state` will be ignored if there is no incoming `transition` at that `state`.  
A loop is also supposed to be an incoming `transition`.

| ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| States | $q_0$ | $q_1$ | $q_2$ | $q_3$ | $q_3$ | $q_3$ | $q_3$ | $q_3$ | $q_3$ |
| Moore  | 0     | 1     | 0     | 1     | 1     | 1     | 1     | 1     | 1     |
| Mealy  |       | 1     | 0     | 1     | 1     | 1     | 1     | 1     | 1     |

## Theorem

### Statement

For every `mealy machine`,[^3] there is an equivalent `moore machine`[^2] ignoring the extra character printed.

### Proof

There can be multiple incoming `transitions` and hence there are following possibilities which may occur.

#### Same Output Characters

If the `transitions` have same output character then shift that character to the corresponding `state`.

#### Different Output Characters

If the `transitions` have different output characters then divide the corresponding `state` into 2 `states` to make sure the incoming `transitions` are only one and unique.  
Meaning, if $q_i$ has 2 incoming `transitions` with character $a$ and $b$ then divide it into $q_i^1$ for $a$ and $q_i^2$ for $b$.  
Though these new `states` should behave like $q_i$.

### Note

If there is no incoming `transition` for a `state` then any character can be associated with that `state`.  
If the initial `state` is converted into multiple `states` then only one of these will be considered as initial `state`.
