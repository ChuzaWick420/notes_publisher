# Lecture No. 21

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 02-01-2025</span>

## Mealy Machine

It consists of the following

- A finite `set`[^1] of `states` $q_0, q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_n$ where $q_0$ is the `initial state`.
- An `alphabet`[^2] of letters $\Sigma = \{a, b, c, \ldots\}$ from which the input `strings`[^2] are formed.
- An `alphabet`[^2] of letters $\Gamma = \{x, y, z, \ldots\}$ from which the output `strings`[^2] are formed.
- A pictorial representation with `states` and directed edges labeled by an input letter along with an output character, showing how to go from one `state` to another.

### Example

![[cs402_e_21_1.svg]]  

$$\text{states} = q_0, q_1, q_2, q_3$$

$$\Sigma = \{a, b\}$$

$$\Gamma = \{0, 1\}$$

| Input  |       | a     | b     | b     | a     | b     | b     | b     | a     |
| ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| States | $q_0$ | $q_1$ | $q_2$ | $q_3$ | $q_3$ | $q_0$ | $q_3$ | $q_0$ | $q_1$ |
| Output |       | 0     | 1     | 1     | 1     | 1     | 0     | 1     | 0     |

## Constructing the Incrementing Machine

![[cs402_e_21_3.svg]]  
If the letter is $0$ at initial `state` then we change it to $1$ and enter _no change `state`_.  
Otherwise if we read a $1$ then we change it to $0$ and enter a `state` where as we keep reading $1$, we remain in that carry `state` and change the $1$ to $0$ but if we read a $0$ afterwards, we change it to $1$ and enter the _no carry `state`_.
