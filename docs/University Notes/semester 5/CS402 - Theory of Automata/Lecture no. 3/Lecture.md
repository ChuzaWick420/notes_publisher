# Lecture No. 2

## Regular Expression

Imagine we have  

$$\Sigma = \{a\}$$

$$L = \{a, aa, aaa, \ldots\}$$

We know that it is represented by $\Sigma^+$.  
Then $a^+$ would be called the `regular expression`.

## Recursive Definition of Regular Expression

1. Every `letter` of $\Sigma$, including $\Lambda$ is a `regular expression`.
2. If $r_1$ and $r_2$ are `regular expressions` then following are also `regular expressions`.

	1. $$r_1$$

	2. $$r_1 r_2$$

	3. $$r_1 + r_2$$

	4. $$r_1^*$$

3. Nothing else is `regular expression`.

> NOTE: A `language` maybe be generated by more than one `regular expressions`

## Examples

Imagine we have $\Sigma = \{a, b\}$ then

### Example

A `language` $L$ consisting of all combinations of `symbols` is defined as $(a + b)^*$.

## Example

A `language` containing at least 1 $a$ `symbol` in each `string`[^1] is defined as $b^*ab^*$.

## Example

A `language` containing `strings`[^1] of even length is defined as $((a + b) (a + b))^*$
