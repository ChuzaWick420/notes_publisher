# Lecture No. 16

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 30-10-2024</span>

## Application of `Non Deterministic Finite Automaton`[^1]

There is an important application of `non deterministic finite automaton`[^1] in `artificial intelligence`.

Imagine a maze as such where `-` is the `initial state` and `+` is the `final state`.

| -   | 1   | 2   | 3   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4   | L   | 5   | O   |
| 6   | M   | 7   | P   |
| 8   | N   | 9   | +   |

One is allowed to only move on the numeric tiles.  
We can determine the number of ways someone can move from `-` to `+` using the following `non deterministic finite automaton`[^1]

![[CS402_e_16_1.svg]]

It is shown that the shortest `string`[^2] which is accepted by the machine is $aaaaaa$.

## Note

1. Every `finite automaton`[^3] can be considered to be a `non deterministic finite automaton`[^1] as well but the converse may not be the true.
2. Every `non deterministic finite automaton`[^1] can be considered to be a `transition graph`[^4] as well but the converse may not be the true.

## `Non Deterministic Finite Automaton`[^1] With Null `String`[^2] $\Lambda$

If $\Lambda$ is allowed to be an edge in a `non deterministic finite automaton`[^1] then it is called `non deterministic finite automaton`[^1] with $\Lambda$.  
It is a collection of three things:

1. Finite many `states` with one `initial` and some `final states`.
2. Finite `set`[^5] of inputs, let's say, $\Sigma =\{a, b, c\}$.
3. There may be more than one transitions for a `letter`, including $\Lambda$ or there may not be any transition at all.

## Converting into `Finite Automaton`[^3] from `Non Deterministic Finite Automaton`[^1]

### Method 1

Since a `non deterministic finite automaton`[^1] is considered a `transition graph`,[^4] a corresponding `regular epression`[^6] can be constructed, using `kleene's theorems`.[^7]  
Similarly, a `finite automaton`[^3] can be constructed from that `regular expression`[^6] resulting into an equivalent `non deterministic finite automaton`.[^1]

### Method 2

For a `non deterministic finite automaton`,[^1] there may be `states` with no transitions, in correspondence to which we can make `finite automaton`[^3] with empty `states`.  
We also have solution for `states` with multiple transitions.

#### Example

Following is our`non deterministic finite automaton`[^1] which needs to be converted
