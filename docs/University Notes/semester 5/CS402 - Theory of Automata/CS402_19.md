## Memory Required to Recognize a Language

It refers to the amount of information an `automaton`[^1] must store at any given time to determine whether a string belongs to the language.  

### Example

Let $L_{20}$ be a `language`[^1] of strings with length equal to or greater than $20$, defined over $\Sigma = \{a, b\}$.  
Then, the total number of `states` required is  

$$2^{20 + 1} - 1= 2,097,151$$

## Distinguishable Strings

Two `strings`[^1] $x$ and $y$, belonging to $\Sigma^*$ are considered `distinguishable` with respect to $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ if there exists $z \in \Sigma^*$ such that $xz \in L$ but $yz \notin L$ or $yz \in L$ but $xz \notin L$.

### Example

Let $L$ be a `language`[^1] of `strings`[^1] defined over $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$ such that they end in $01$.  
The `strings`[^1] $110$ and $010011$ are `distinguishable` with respect to $L$ as there exists $1 \in \Sigma^*$ such that $1101$ belongs to $L$ but $010011$ doesn't belongs to $L$.

## Indistinguishable Strings

Two `strings`[^1] $x$ and $y$, belonging to $\Sigma^*$ are considered `indistinguishable` with respect to $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ if there exists $z \in \Sigma^*$ such that either $xz \in L$ and $yz \in L$ or $xz \notin L$ and $yz \notin L$.

### Example

Let $L$ be a `language`[^1] of `strings`[^1] defined over $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$ such that they end in $01$.  
The `strings`[^1] $111$ and $010011$ are `indistinguishable` with respect to $L$ as there exists $1 \in \Sigma^*$ such that both $1111$ and $0100111$ don't belongs to $L$.

## Theorem

If $L$ is a `language`[^1] defined over $\Sigma$ and there are $n$ `strings`[^1] from $\Sigma^*$ such that any two are [distinguishable strings](#distinguishable-strings) with respect to `language`[^1] $L$ then any `finite automaton`[^2] which recognizes $L$ must have at least $n$ `states`.

> [!NOTE] There may not exist any `finite automaton`[^2] which recognizes $L$.

### Proof

Let $S$ be a `set`[^3] of `strings`[^1] with respect to `language`[^1] $L$ and contains two `strings`[^1] such that they are [distinguishable](#distinguishable-strings).  
Let $F$ be a `finite automaton`[^2] which recognizes $L$.  
Because the `strings`[^1] are [distinguishable](#distinguishable-strings), each should end at different `state` of $F$.  
This will prove that if we have $n$ different `strings`[^1] then there will be $n$ different `states` where each of them will end.

#### Contradiction

Let's assume that any two or more `strings`[^1] end in same `state`.  
This violates the fact that they are [distinguishable](#distinguishable-strings), hence proving that there _has to be_ $n$ `states`.
