# Lecture No. 05

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 25-10-2024</span>

We can represent it as this diagram.  
Here, we define the `initial state` with an arrow pointing to that `state` and double circle for `final state`.  
The labels for transition of `states` are not necessary.

## Example

Consider a `language` $L$ with `strings`[^1] of length 2 or more, beginning and ending with same `letters`.  

$$a(a + b)^*a + b(a + b)^*b$$
