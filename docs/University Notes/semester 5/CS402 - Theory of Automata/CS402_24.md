# Lecture No. 24

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 23-02-2025</span>

## Regular Languages

Read about [[cs402_04|regular languages]].

### By Regular Expressions

Read about [[cs402_03|regular expressions]].

### By Transition Graphs

Read about [[cs402_07|transition graphs]] and [[cs402_10|Kleene's theorem]].

### Example

![[cs402_e_24_1.svg]]  
/// caption  
Consider 2 `transition graphs`[^1]  
///

![[cs402_e_24_2.svg]]  
/// caption  
`Transition graph`[^1] of $L_1 + L_2$.  
///

![[cs402_e_24_3.svg]]  
/// caption  
`Transition graph`[^1] of $L_1L_2$.  
///

![[cs402_e_24_4.svg]]  
/// caption  
`Transition graph`[^1] of $L_2^*$.  
///

## Complement of a Language

If $L$ is a `language`[^2] defined over $\Sigma$ then the `language`[^2] made out of `strings`[^2] which are also defined over $\Sigma$ but are not present in $L$ is called the `complement` of `language`[^2] $L$.  
It is denoted as $L^c$ or $L^\prime$.

## Theorem

### Statement

If $L$ is a `regular language`[^3] then $L^c$ is also a `regular language`.[^3]

### Proof

If $L$ is a `regular language`,[^3] that means it can be represented by a `regular expression`[^4] which further means, it can be represented by a `finite automaton`[^5]  
(by `Kleene's theorem`[^6]).  
After converting to `finite automaton`[^5] we can make the final `states` as non-final and non-final `states` as final ones. This new `finite automaton`[^5] now represents $L^c$.  
It can again, be represented by a `regular expression`[^4] (by `Kleene's thoerem`[^6]) which makes it a `regular language`.[^3]

### Example

Let $L$ be a `language` over alphabet $\Sigma = \{a, b\}$ consisting of only 2 words, $aba$ and $abb$.  

![[cs402_e_24_5.svg]]  
/// caption  
`Finite automaton`[^5] of $L$.  
///

![[cs402_e_24_6.svg]]  
/// caption  
`Finite automaton`[^5] of $L^c$.  
///

## Theorem

### Statement

If $L_1$ and $L_2$ are 2 `regular languages`,[^3] then $L_1 \cap L_2$ is also a `regular language`.[^3]

### Proof

Using `De Morgan's law`,  

$$(L_1^c \, \cup L_2^c)^c = L_1 \, \cap \, L_2$$

If $L_1$ and $L_2$ are `regular languages`[^3] then $L_1^c$ and $L_2^c$ are also `regular languages`,[^3] which means $L_1^c \, \cup \, L_2^c$ is also `regular language`,[^3] which further implies that $(L_1^c \, \cup \, L_2^c)^c$ is also a `regular language`.[^3]
