# Lecture No. 8

In a `transition graph`,[^1] the `strings`[^2] which don't have a complete path from `initial state` to `final state` are rejected by `transition graph`[^1] meanwhile the ones which _do_ have at least one path are accepted and is part of the `language` accepted by `transition graph`[^1]

> NOTE: Every `finite automaton`[^3] is a `transition graph`[^1] but every `transition graph`[^1] may not be a `finite automaton`.[^3]

The following `transition graphs` has no `final state` at all, meaning they do not accepts any `strings`[^2]  
However, the last one is also a `finite automaton` [^3]
