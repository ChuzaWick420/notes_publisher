The `grammatical rules` which involve meanings of the `words` are called `semantics` meanwhile which don't are called `syntactics`.  
In general, the rules of a `computer language` are all `syntactical` and not `semantical`.  
A `law of grammar` is just a suggestion for possible `substitutions`.

## Terminologies

### Terminals

The symbols which cannot be replaced by other symbols.

### Non Terminals

The symbols that must be replaced by other things are called `non terminals`.

### Productions

The `grammatical rules` are often called `productions`.

## Context Free Grammar

It is a collection of the following

- An `alphabet`[^1] $\Sigma$ of `letters` called [terminals](#terminals) from which the `strings`[^1] (`words`[^1] of the `language`[^1]) are formed.
- A `set`[^2] of symbols called `non terminals`, one of which is $S$ which stands for "Start Here".
- A finite `set`[^2] of [productions](#productions) of the form [non terminal](#non-terminals) â†’ finite `string`[^1] of [terminals](#terminals) and/or [non terminals](#non-terminals).

> [!NOTE] [Non Terminals](#non-terminals) are capitalized meanwhile [terminals](#terminals) are not.

## Context Free Language

A language generated by [context free grammar](#context-free-grammar) is called `context free language`.

### Example

$$\Sigma = \{a\}$$

#### Productions

$$S \to SS$$

$$S \to a$$

$$S \to \Lambda$$

#### Language Defined

$$a^*$$

> [!NOTE]- $\Lambda$ has special purpose.  
> It is not considered a [terminal](#terminal). It just means that if there's a [production](#productions) for a [non terminal](#non-terminals) such that $N \to \Lambda$ then $N$ can be deleted from the `string`.[^1]

### Example

$$\Sigma = \{a, b\}$$

#### Productions

$$S \to X$$

$$S \to Y$$

$$X \to \Lambda$$

$$Y \to aY$$

$$Y \to bY$$

$$Y \to a$$

$$Y \to b$$

#### Language Defined

$$(a + b)^*$$
