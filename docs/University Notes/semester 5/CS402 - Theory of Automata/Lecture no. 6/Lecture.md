# Lecture No. 6

## Example

Consider a `language` $L$ of `strings`[^1] such that each one starts and ends with a different `letter`.  

$$a (a + b)^* b + b (a + b)^* a$$

## Equivalent Finite Automaton

Two `finite automata`[^2] which accept the same language are called `equivalent finite automata`.  
The following 3 `finite automata` are `equivalent`.

The inputs for these would be $\Phi$ or $\{\}$ because there is no `final state`.  
Even if there is, it is impossible to reach.

## Example

A `language` $L$ defined over $\Sigma = \{a, b\}$ consisting of `strings`[^1] having either triple $a$ or $b$.  

$$(a + b)^*(aaa + bbb)(a + b)^*$$
