# Lecture No. 2

## Kleene Star Closure

Given a $\Sigma$, the `kleene star closure` denoted by $\Sigma^*$ is a `set`[^1] of all possible `strings`[^2] which can be derived out of $\Sigma$.

### Example

$$\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$$

$$\Sigma^* = \{\Lambda, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, \ldots\}$$

> `Languages` generated by `kleene star closure` are infinite, meaning they have infinite amount of `words`[^2] with infinite about of length.

## Plus Operation +

It is same as [kleene star closure](#kleene-star-closure) but it does not generates $\Lambda$.

### Example

$$\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$$

$$\Sigma^+ = \{0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, \ldots\}$$

## Recursive Definition

Following 3 steps are used to define a `language` recursively:

1. Some basic words are specified in the `language`.
2. Rules for constructing more words are defined in a `language`.
3. Only the `strings`[^2] generated by the above step is allowed in the `language`.

### Example

1. $x$ is an `integer`.
2. If $x$ is an `integer` then $x + 1$ and $x - 1$ are also `integers`.
3. Any other `string`[^2] generated which does no follows `step 2` is not allowed in the `language`.
