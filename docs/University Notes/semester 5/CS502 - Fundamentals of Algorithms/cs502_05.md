# C5 Linear time Sorting

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 13-01-2025</span>

## Counting Sort

Imagine 3 `arrays`:

- $A[1 .. n]$ containing the initial inputs.
- $B[1 .. n]$ containing the sorted outputs.
- $C[1 .. k]$ containing the `ranks` such that $C[x]$ is the `rank` of $x$ in $A$ where $x \in [1 .. k]$.

The $C[1 .. k]$ is constructed in following way:

- The $C[1 .. k]$ is initialized with $0$.
- We run across $A$ using index $j \in [1 .. n]$.
- Increment each $C[A[j]]$.

> [!note] Now index of each entry in $C$ represents the value in $A$ and the entry represents the `rank` of that value.

- Run across $C$ and do $C[i] = C[i] + C[i - 1]$.  

> [!info]- Structure of $C$  
> Consider an example where  
> 
> $$C = \{2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 2\}$$
> 
> $$\rightarrow$$
> 
> $$C = \{2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 9, 11\}$$

The algorithm works as follows:
- Run across $A$ using index $j \in [1 .. n]$ backwards, let each value be $x$.
- $C[x]$ is the indexed cell within $B$ which we want to select.
- $x$ is the value placed inside the selected cell.
- Decrement $C[x]$ after placing $x$ in $B[C[x]]$.

```
counting_sort(array A, array B, int k) {
	for i <- 1 to k
	do C[i] <- 0 // k times
	for j <- 1 to length[A]
	do C[A[j]] <- C[A[j]] + 1 // n times
	// C[i] now contains the number of elements = i
	for i <- 2 to k
	do C[i] <- C[i] + C[i - 1] // k times
	// C[i] now contains the number of elements <= i
	for j <- length[A] downto 1
	do B[A[j]] <- A[j]
		C[A[j]] <- C[A[j]] - 1 // n times
}
```

[Counting Sort](#counting-sort) is not `in-place`[^1] but is `stable`.[^1] Here is an illustration.

/// caption  
`4` at right side within $A$ is also sorted in right side in $B$.  
///

![[Pasted image 20250130195057.png]]

///

## Bucket or Bin Sort

```
BucketSort(array A, int n, int M) {
// Pre-condition: for 1 <= i <= n, 0 <= a[i] < M
// Mark all the bins empty
for i <- 1 to M
do bin[i] <- Empty
for i <- 1 to n
do bin[A[i]] <- A[i]
}
```

If there are $n$ keys then placing all the keys in appropriate bins is going to take $O(n)$ operations.  
If there were $m$ bins then we would also need to figure out if there are elements in each bin or not.  
This would take $O(m)$ operations.  
So the whole algorithm's time is:  

$$T(n) = c_1n + c_2m$$

If $m \le n$ then the running time is $O(n)$.  
If $m >> n$ then the running time is $O(m)$.

## Radix Sort

The limitation with [counting sort](#counting-sort) is that it works great if $k$ is small but if $k$ is in millions then the `rank` would also be in millions but `radix sort` provides a nice work around.  

![[Pasted image 20250130200835.png]]  
/// caption  
Radix sort  
///

```
RadixSort(array A, int n, int d) {
	for i <- 1 to d
	do stably sort A with respect to ith lowest order digit
}
```
