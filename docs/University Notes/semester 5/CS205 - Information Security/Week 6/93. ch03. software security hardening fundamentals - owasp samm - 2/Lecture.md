- OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)
    - Construction Phase:
        - Security Requirements
        - Threat Assessment
        - Secure Architecture
- Security Requirements:
    - Focused on proactively specifying the expected behavior of software with respect to security
	- Through addition of analysis activities at the project level, security requirements are initially gathered based on the high-level business purpose of the software

- Threat Assessment:
    - Centered on identification and understanding the project-level risks based on the functionality of the software being developed and characteristics of the runtime environment from details about threats and likely attacks against each project, the organization as a whole operates more effectively through better decisions about prioritization of initiatives for security

- Secure Architecture:
    - Focused on proactive steps for an organization to design and build secure software by default.

- Policy & Compliance:
    - By enhancing the software design process with reusable services and components, the overall security risk from software development can be dramatically reduced.
- SAMM is an excellent model for software security and we look at the verification and deployment phases as part of testing and validation (future module)
