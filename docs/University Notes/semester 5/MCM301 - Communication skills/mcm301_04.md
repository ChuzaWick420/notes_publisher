# 04. Communication in Organizations

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 21-12-2024</span>

## Guiding Principle

1. People are not mind readers. They judge you based on your behavior, not intentions. We always communicate something by our tone of voice, gestures etc even if we try not to. Similarly, we always receive communications from others as well.
2. A word is like an arrow. It never returns once it has left the bow. Once a word is uttered, it _will_ create some sort of impression.
3. We don't exchange ideas but rather symbols which represent those ideas. 

### Mediated Communication

This communication happens when 2 parties use some intermediate means to communicate.  
They don't communicate face to face and there is no direct feedback.  
**Examples:** Radio, Phone, TV, letters.

### Person to Group Communication

It involves one `speaker` and `audience`.  
The `speaker` faces the `audience` which consists of people with similar interests.  
The traditional `speaker` and `audience` setting may include microphones, projectors etc.

### Mass Communication

It includes sending a `message` to a large, dissimilar, anonymous, distant `audience` through some intermediate instrument such as newspapers or TV.  
The `mass media` includes:

- Books
- Newspapers
- Magazines
- TV
- Radio
- Audio or Video recording
- Computers and computer networks

1. Planning

3. Staffing
4. Controlling
5. Directing

It is used for speeding up the communication and works horizontally.
