# 14. Clipping - 1

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 13-05-2025</span>

## Concept

To protect other portions of the canvas, the graphics primitives are not drawn outside a rectangular boundary called `clipping rectangle`.  
The default `clipping rectangle` is the full screen itself.

## Point Clipping

We will save a `point` $(x, y)$ only if

$$x_\text{min} \le x \le x_\text{max}$$

$$y_\text{min} \le y \le y_\text{max}$$

## Line Clipping

$$x = x_1 + u(x_2 - x_1)$$

$$y = y_1 + u(y_2 - y_1)$$

$$u \in [0, 1]$$

If $u$ is not in this range then the line does not enters the `clipping rectangle`.

## Solve Simultaneous Equations

Consider 2 end points of a `line`.[^1] If both are inside the `clipping rectangle` then it is accepted. If either one or both points are outside, then we need to find if there are any intersections with `clipping boundary` and then check for interior points again.

> [!TIP] We don't have to touch the infinitely interior points of the `line`[^1] but just its end points.

## The Cohen-sutherland Line-clipping Algorithm

Extend the `clipping boundaries` so that the screen is divided into 9 sub regions.

![[cs604_e_14_2.svg]]

The data represented by each `bit` in these 4 `bits` code, assigned to each sub region, is as follows:

1. $y > y_\text{max}$
2. $y < y_\text{min}$
3. $x > x_\text{max}$
4. $x < x_\text{min}$

This algorithm is useful to keep computing intersections at minimal.

## Liang-barsky Algorithm

$$x_{\text{min}} \le x_1 + u \Delta x \le x_{\text{max}}$$

$$y_{\text{min}} \le y_1 + u \Delta y \le y_{\text{max}}$$

These inequalities can be summed up as  

$$u \times p_k \le q_k, \quad k = 1, 2, 3, 4$$

### Definitions of $p_k$ and $q_k$

$$p_1 = - \Delta x, \quad q_1 = x_1 - x_{\text{min}}$$

$$p_2 = - \Delta x, \quad q_2 = x_{\text{max}} - x_1$$

$$p_3 = - \Delta y, \quad q_3 = y_1 - y_{\text{min}}$$

$$p_4 = - \Delta y, \quad q_4 = y_{\text{max}} - y_1$$

The $k$ indices represent following `edges` of the `clipping rectangle`.

1. right
2. left
3. bottom
4. top

For each `edge` $k$, if $p_k​ = 0$ and $q_k ​< 0$, the `line`[^1] is parallel and outside → reject.  
If ($p_k \ne 0$) $r_k = \frac{p_k}{q_k}$​  
if ($p_k < 0$) $u_1 = \max(0, r_k) \quad \forall k$  
if ($p_k > 0$) $u_2 = \min(1, r_k) \quad \forall k$  
if $(u_1 > u_2)$ accept the line  
else clip the `line`[^1]
