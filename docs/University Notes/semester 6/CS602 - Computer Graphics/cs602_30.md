# 30. Mathematics of Lighting and Shading part 4

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 02-07-2025</span>

## Light Attenuation

$$f_{\text{atten}} = \frac 1 {k_c + k_1 d + k_2 d^2}$$

Here $f_\text{atten}$ is the `attenuation` factor, which is amount of `intensity` `light` loses as the distance $d$ between the photon and its source increases.  
The `lighting equation` with `attenuation` looks like

$$i_\text{total} = i_a + \sum f_\text{atten} (i_d + i_s)$$

## Schlick's Simplification for the Specular Exponential Term

In this simplification, the $(S)^{m_s}$ factor in `Phong` or `Blinn Phong`[^1] is replaced by  

$$\frac S {m_s - m_sS + S}$$

## `Oren - Nayar` `Diffuse`[^2] Reflection

Full Moon

The full moon does not show `Lambertian diffuse shading`. In fact, due to the rough surface, it also backscatter some `light`.  
`Oren` and `Nayar [OREN 1992]` came up with a generalized version of a `Lambertian diffuse shading model` that tries to account for the roughness of the `surface`.

$$i_d = \frac \rho \pi E_0 \cos (\theta_i)(A + B \max (0, \cos (\phi_r - \phi_i))\sin(\alpha)\tan(\beta))$$

$$\text{where } A = 1 - 0.5 \frac {\sigma^2}{\sigma^2 + 0.33} \text{ and } B = 0.45 \frac {\sigma^2}{\sigma^2 + 0.09}$$

> [!NOTE]- The terms  
> - $\frac \rho \pi$ is a surface `reflectivity` property, which can be replaced with our `surface diffuse color`.
> - $E_0$ is a `light` input energy term, which can be replaced with our `light diffuse color`[^2]

$$i_d = (m_d \otimes s_d) (\hat n \cdot \hat l)(A + B \max (0, \cos (\phi_r - \phi_i))\sin(\alpha)\tan(\beta))$$

> [!NOTE]- More terms  
> - $\rho$ is the `surface roughness parameter`. It's the `standard deviation` in radians of the angle of distribution of the `microfacets` in the `surface roughness model`. The larger the value, the rougher the `surface`.
> - $\theta_r$ is the `angle` between the `vertex normal`[^3] and the view direction.
> - $\phi_r - \phi_i$ is the circular angle (about the `vertex normal`[^3]) between the `light vector`[^4] and the view `vector`.[^4]
> - $\alpha$ is $\max(\theta_i, \theta_r)$
> - $\beta$ is $\min(\theta_i, \theta_r)$

> [!NOTE]- Additional notes  
> If the `roughness` value is $0$, the model is same as `Lambertian diffuse model`. `Oren` and `Nayar` also note that we can replace the value $0.33$ in coefficient $A$ with $0.57$ to better account for `surface inter-reflection`.
