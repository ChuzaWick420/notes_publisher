# 21. Triangles and Planes

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 14-05-2025</span>

## Triangle

Just like how `pixels` are primitive to 2D graphics, `triangles` are primitives to 3D graphics.

```cpp
struct Triangle {
	int v[3];

	Triangle() {}
	
	Triangle(int v1, int v2, int v3) {
		v[0] = v1;
		v[1] = v2;
		v[2] = v3;
	}
};
```

## Strips and Fans

![[cs602_e_21_1.svg]]  
/// caption

///

The first 3 elements indicate the first `triangle`.  
Then each last element is connected to first element (`vertex 0`).

## Planes

The implicit equation for a `plane` is  

$$ax + by + cz + d = 0$$

Where any triplet $(x, y, z)$ satisfying the above equation, is a `point` on that `plane`.  
$\langle a, b, c \rangle$ is a `normal vector`,[^1] perpendicular to all `points` on the `plane`.  
$d$ is the distance of `origin` from the `plane`.

![[cs602_e_21_3.svg]]  
/// caption  
When the `normal vector`[^1] is pointing _away_ from the `origin`, the distance to the `plane` is negative.  
///

![[cs602_e_21_4.svg]]  
/// caption  
When the `normal vector`[^1] is pointing _in_ towards the `origin`, the distance to the `plane` is positive.  
///

> [!NOTE] $\vec n$ can be of any length.

### Constructing a `Plane` from Three `Points` on the Plane

![[cs602_e_21_5.svg]]  

$$\vec n = (\vec{P_3 - P_1}) \times (\vec{P_2 - P_1})$$

$$\hat n = \frac{\vec n}{|\vec n|}$$

$$d = - (\vec P_1 \cdot \hat n)$$

### Constructing a `Plane` from a `point` and `Normal` on the `Plane`

$$\hat n = \frac{\vec n}{|\vec n|}$$

$$d = - (\vec P \cdot \hat n)$$

### Defining Locality with relation to a `Plane`

Let  

$$ax + by + cz + d = g$$

Then

- $g = 0$ - `point` is on the `plane`
- $g < 0$ - `points` is behind the `plane`
- $g > 0$ - `points` is in front of the `plane`

> [!NOTE] The front of the `plane` is the side where the `normal vector`[^1] is coming outwards.

### Back-face Culling

![[cs602_e_21_6.svg]]  
/// caption  
Left Hand Rule suggests that if you grab the `normal vector`[^1] with left hand and curl fingers (clockwise direction) then thumb (`normal`) refers to the "front".  
///

We can now easily determine if `camera` is facing the front or back of a `triangle`.  

- Back - $\vec P \cdot \hat n > 0$
- Front - $\vec P \cdot \hat n < 0$  

Back face culling suggests that we reject the `triangles` of a `polygon` which are faced _away_ from `camera`.

![[cs602_e_21_7.svg]]  
/// caption  
This cube's `mesh` is made from $6$ `planes` = $12$ `triangles`. The `triangles` with dotted `edges` where not rendered as their `normal`[^1] is _away_ from the `camera` i.e. `camera` is looking at the back sides which don't need to be rendered.  
///

## Clipping Lines

![[cs602_e_21_8.svg]]

$$\vec D = P_B - P_A$$

$$P_\text{intersection} =\vec P_A + s \times \vec D$$

The above equation represents

- A `vector`[^1] $\vec D$ starting from a `point` $P_A$.
- $\vec D$ is directed towards $\vec P_B$.
- $s$ is a `scalar` which controls the length of $\vec D$.

We know that `plane` can be defined with the following [equation](#constructing-a-plane-from-a-point-and-normal-on-the-plane).

$$d = - \vec P \cdot \hat n$$

$$-d = \vec P \cdot \hat n$$

$$-d = (\vec P_A + s \times \vec D) \cdot \hat n$$

$$-d = \vec P_A \cdot n + s \times \vec D \cdot \hat n$$

$$-d - \vec P_A \cdot n = s \times \vec D \cdot \hat n$$

$$\frac{-d - \vec P_A \cdot n}{\vec D \cdot \hat n} = s$$

$$\frac{-d - \vec P_A \cdot n}{(\vec{P_B} - \vec{P_A}) \cdot \hat n} = s$$

$$\frac{-d - \vec P_A \cdot n}{\vec{P_B} \cdot \hat n - \vec{P_A} \cdot \hat n} = s$$

```cpp
inline const point3 Plane3::split(const point3 &a, const point3 &b) const {
	float aDot = a * n;
	float bDot = b * n;

	float scale = (-d - aDot) / (bDot - aDot);
	
	return a + (scale * (b - a));
}
```
