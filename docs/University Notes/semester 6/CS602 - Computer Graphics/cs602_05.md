# 05. Line Drawing Techniques

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 14-04-2025</span>

## Line

A `line`, or `straight line`, is, roughly speaking, an (infinitely) thin, (infinitely) long, straight geometrical object, i.e. a `curve` that is long and straight.

### Colinear Points

Three or more points that lie on the same line are called `collinear`.

## Techniques to Draw a `line`

### Incremental line Algorithm

We will exploit  

$$y = mx + b$$

where  

$$m = \frac{dy}{dx}$$

$$b = y - mx$$

#### Algorithm

```python
def Incremental_Line (Point p1, Point p2):
	dx = p2.x – p1.x
	dy = p2.y – p1.y
	m = dy / dx
	x = p1.x
	y = p1.y
	b = y – m * x
	
	if len(m) < 1:
		for counter in range(p1.x, p2.x):
			drawPixel (x, y)
			x = x + 1
			y = m * x + b
	else
		for counter in range(p1.y, p2.y):
			drawPixel (x, y)
			y = y + 1
			x = (y - b) / m
```

> [!QUESTION]- Why is it that we have two cases, i.e. $|m| < 1$ and $|m| > 1$, why not just increment either $x$ or $y$ and then find out the other one.
> - $|m| < 1$ implies that for each increment in $x$, the increment in $y$ is $< 1$, taking us into `subpixel`. If we were to use $y$ for increment in this case, it would miss out some discrete values of $x$, hence creating gaps.
> - Vise versa for $|m| > 1$.

### Digital Differential Analyzer (`DDA`) line Algorithm

```python
if len(dx) > len(dy):
	steps = len(dx)
else
	steps = len(dy)
```

Here, `step` is the total number of `pixels`.[^1]

```python
xIncrement = dx / steps
yIncrement = dy / steps
```

Then 

```python
for counter in range(1, steps):
	drawPixel(x1, y1)
	x1 = x1 + xIncrement
	y1 = y1 + yIncrement
```

### Bresenham's line Algorithm

Assume a [line](#line) with `slope`[^2] $m < 1$, then if the current `point` is $(x_i, y_i)$ then the next `point` can be either of the following

- $(x_i + 1, y_i)$
- $(x_i + 1, y_i + 1)$

The actual position on the [line](#line) is $(x_i + 1, m(x_i + 1) + c)$.  
Now taking `distance` of this true `point` from the top and bottom of the pixel respectively ($d_2$ and $d_1$) gives us

$$d_1 = y - y_i = m \times (x_i + 1) + b - y_i$$

$$d_2 = y_i + 1 - y = y_i + 1 - m(x_i + 1) - b$$

Let's define a decision `function`[^3] $p$ as  

$$p_i = dx (d_1 - d_2)$$

$$\therefore d_1 > d_2 \implies p_i > 0$$

Plugging in the values of $d_1$ and $d_2$ while also knowing that $m = \frac {dy}{dx}$, we get  

$$p_i = 2dy(x_i + 1) - 2dx y_i + dx(2b - 1)$$

Abstracting away a section of this equation into $k=2 dy + dx (2b-1)$, we get

$$p_i = 2dyx_i - 2dxy_i + k$$

Now we calculate $p_{i + 1}$

$$p_{i+1} = 2\,dy\,x_{i+1} - 2\,dx\,y_{i+1} + k$$

$$\because x_{i + 1} = x_i + 1$$

$$p_{i+1} = 2\,dy\,(x_i + 1) - 2\,dx\,y_{i+1} + k$$

$$p_{i+1} = 2\,dy\,x_i + 2\,dy - 2\,dx\,y_{i+1} + k$$

Now evaluating

$$p_{i + 1} - p_i$$

we get

$$p_{i+1} = p_i + 2\,dy - 2\,dx\,(y_{i+1} - y_i)$$

So now  

$$d_1 > d_2 \implies p_{i + 1} = p_i + 2dy - 2dx$$

$$d_1 < d_2 \implies p_{i + 1} = p_i + 2dy$$

Also, plugging in $b = y - mx$ into $p_i$, a lot of terms cancel out and we are remained with  

$$p_i = 2dy - dx$$

#### Algorithm

```python
dx = x2 - x1
dy = y2 - y1
p = 2 dy - dx
c1 = 2 dy
c2 = 2 (dy - dx)
x = x1
y = y1

plot(x, y, color)

while (x < x2):
	x++;
	
	if (p < 0):
		p = p + c1
	else
		p = p + c2
		
	y++
	
	plot(x, y, color)
```

### Improving Performance

We can improve the applications by

- Replacing `function`[^3] calls with `macros` or inline code.
- Unrolling the `loops`

We can calculate the next `frame buffer`[^4] by calculating the first one and then replacing `x++` with `address++` and `y++` with `address = address + XResolution`.

### Improved Versions of Bresenham's Algorithm

- Symmetry (forward and backward simultaneously)  
- Segmentation (divide into smaller identical segments - GCD(Dx, Dy) )  
- Double step, triple step, n step

## Settings a Pixel

Initial task: load the `frame buffer`[^4] or `bitmap`[^4]  
Assume the simplest case: 8-bit, non-interlaced graphics system.  
Then each `byte` in the `frame buffer`[^4] corresponds to a `pixel`[^1] position.  

$$\text{addr}(X, Y) = \text{addr}(0, 0) + Y \times (X_m + 1) + X(\text{all in bytes})$$

- $\text{addr}(X, Y)$ - The `address` of the `pixel`[^1] at $(X, Y)$ coordinates.
- $\text{addr}(0, 0)$ - The `address` of the initial `pixel`.[^1]
- $(X_m + 1)$ - Number of `pixels`[^1] per `raster line`(row).
