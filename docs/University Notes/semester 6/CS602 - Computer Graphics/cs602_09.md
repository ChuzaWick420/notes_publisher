# 09. Filled Area Primitives - 2

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 12-05-2025</span>

## Boundary Fill

We can find `paint-scan function` in common interactive paint packages.  
Idea is to have a closed `figure`, then selecting a `point` within the `figure` with a `color` to fill.

The algorithm requires has parameters:

- `Coordinates` of starting `point`
- Fill `color`
- `Color` of boundary

### Algorithm

- Check the `pixel` for boundary `color`
- Check the `pixel` for fill `color`
- Set the `pixel` in fill `color`
- Run the process for neighbors

## Flood Fill

Sometimes, we may want to replace the `color` of all _connected_ `pixels`.  
For this case, we just need something like `#!cpp if(getPixel(x, y).color == oldColor)`.

## Neighbors
