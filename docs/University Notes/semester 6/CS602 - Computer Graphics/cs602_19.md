# 19. Projections

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 14-05-2025</span>

## Projections

It can be defined as mapping of a `point` $P(x, y, z)$ onto its image $P^\prime(x^\prime, y^\prime, z^\prime)$ in the `projection plane` or `view plane`, which constitutes the display surface.  
The mapping is determined by a `projection line` called the `projector` that passes through $P$ and intersects the `view plane`.

## Methods

There are 2 methods to do `projection`.

- Parallel projection
- Perspective projection

## Taxonomy of Projection

![[cs602_i_19_1.png]]  
/// caption  
`Orthographic` = `Projectors` are perpendicular to `view plane`.  
`Oblique` = `Projectors` are not perpendicular to `view plane`.  
`Multiview` = `View plane` is parallel to `principal planes`.  
`Axonometric` = `View plane` is not parallel to `principal planes`.

## Parallel Projection

`Parallel projection` methods are used by `drafters` and `engineers` to create working diagrams of objects which preserve their original `scale` and `shape`.  
The complete representation of these details often require multiple `views`(`projections`) of the object onto different `view planes`.

The direction of `projection` is prescribed for all `projections`.  
`Orthographic projections` are characterized by the fact that the direction of `projection` is perpendicular to the `view plane`.

## Mathematical Description of a Parallel Projection

Projection rays (`projectors`) emanate from a `Center of Projection`(COP) and intersect `Projection Plane` (PP).  
The COP for `parallel projectors` is at $\infty$.  
The length of a `line`[^1] on the `projection plane` is same as the `true length`.

### Types of `Parallel Projections`

#### Orthographic Projection

If the direction of `projection` is perpendicular to the `projection plane` then it is an `orthographic projection`.

##### Axonometric Orthographic Projection

`Orthographic projections` that show more than one side of an `object` are called `axonometric orthographic projections`.

There are three `axonometric projections`

###### Isometric

The `projection plane` intersects the $x, y, z$ axes at equal distances and the `projection plane normal` makes an equal angle with the three axes.

###### Dimetric

The direction of `projection` makes equal angles with exactly two of the principal axes.

###### Trimetric

The direction of `projection` makes unequal angles with the three principal axes.

### Oblique Projection

If the direction of `projection` is not perpendicular to the `projection plane` then it is an `oblique projection`.  
In some applications packages, an `oblique projection vector` is specified with two angles, $\alpha$ and $\phi$.

![[cs602_e_19_3.svg]]  
/// caption  
<span style="color: skyblue;">Blue</span> lines are within `projection plane`. The `line`[^1] between $(x, y)$ and $(x, y, z)$ is perpendicular to the `projection plane`.  
///

$$\cos(\phi) = \frac{x_p - x}{L}$$

$$\sin(\phi) = \frac{y_p - y}{L}$$

$$x_p = x + L \cos(\phi)$$

$$y_p = y + L \sin(\phi)$$

$$\tan(\theta) = \frac z L \implies L = z \cot(\theta)$$

The `oblique projection equations` are  

$$x_p = x + z \cot(\theta) \cos(\phi)$$

$$y_p = y + z \cot(\theta) \sin(\phi)$$

The transformation `matrix`[^2] can be written as

$$
M = 
\begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 0 & \cot(\theta)\cos(\phi) & 0 \\
	0 & 1 & \cot(\theta)\sin(\phi) & 0 \\
	0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
	0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

#### Two Special Cases of Oblique Projection

##### Cavalier

If $\tan(\theta) = 1$ then the `projection` is `cavalier`.

##### Cabinet

If $\tan(\theta) = 2$ then the `projection` is `cabinet`.
