# 40. Fractals

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 07-07-2025</span>

`Fractal` are geometric patterns that is repeated at ever smaller scales to produce irregular shapes and surfaces that can not be represented by classical geometry. `Fractals` are used in computer modeling of irregular patterns and structure in nature.

According to `Webster`'s Dictionary a `fractal` is defined as being 

> [!QUOTE] "Derived from the Latin word `fractus` meaning broken, uneven: any of various extremely irregular curves or shapes that repeat themselves at any scale on which they are examined."

`Mandelbrot`, the discoverer of fractals gives two definitions:

> [!QUOTE] "I coined `fractal` from the Latin adjective `fractus`. The corresponding Latin verb `frangere` means 'to break:' to create irregular fragments. It is therefore sensible - and how appropriate for our needs! - that, in addition to 'fragmented' (as in fraction or refraction), `fractus` should also mean 'irregular,' both meanings being preserved in fragment"

> [!QUOTE] Every `set`[^1] with a non-integer (Hausdorff-Besicovitch) dimension (D) is a `fractal`. However not every `fractal` has an integer $D$. A `fractal` is by definition a `set`[^1] for which $D$ strictly exceeds the topological dimension (D^).

## Hausdorff Besicovitch (`Fractal` dimension)

First, we need to understand the `fractal` dimension. So first we have to develop an understanding of “how to calculate the _dimension_ of an object”.

Imagine the 3 different objects:

![[cs602_e_40_1.svg]]  
/// caption  
Dividing the `line`[^2] into $\frac 1 4$. The idea is self similarity.  
///

![[cs602_e_40_2.svg]]  
/// caption  
Dividing the `square` into $\frac 1 4$.  
///

![[cs602_e_40_3.svg]]  
/// caption  
Dividing the `cube` into $\frac 1 4$.  
///

If we pay attention to the pattern common in all three, we immediately see that

$$4 = 4^1$$

$$16 = 4^2$$

$$64 = 4^3$$

This gives us equation

$$N = S^D$$

Here $N$ is the total number of smaller pieces, $S$ is the `scale` of 1 small piece compared to larger piece and $D$ is called the `dimension`.

$$\implies D = \frac {\log N} {\log S}$$

This `dimension` is the `Hausdorff Besicovitch dimension`.

## Koch Curve

![[cs602_e_40_4.svg]]  
/// caption  
An `equilateral triangle` with total length of curve being $3$.  
///

![[cs602_e_40_5.svg]]  
/// caption  
Length is now $4$ .  
///

Continue this process and eventually we will get something like

![[cs602_i_40_1.png]]  
/// caption

///

![[cs602_i_40_2.png]]  
/// caption

///

## Fractal Geometry

- For 1 dimensional object (a point on a light), we just need 1 value to describe it.
- For 2 dimensional object (a point on a plane), we need 2 values to describe it.
- For 3 dimensional object (a point in a space), we need 3 values to describe it.
