# 40. Fractals

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 07-07-2025</span>

`Fractal` are geometric patterns that is repeated at ever smaller scales to produce irregular shapes and surfaces that can not be represented by classical geometry. `Fractals` are used in computer modeling of irregular patterns and structure in nature.

According to `Webster`'s Dictionary a `fractal` is defined as being 

> [!QUOTE] "Derived from the Latin word `fractus` meaning broken, uneven: any of various extremely irregular curves or shapes that repeat themselves at any scale on which they are examined."

`Mandelbrot`, the discoverer of fractals gives two definitions:

> [!QUOTE] "I coined `fractal` from the Latin adjective `fractus`. The corresponding Latin verb `frangere` means 'to break:' to create irregular fragments. It is therefore sensible - and how appropriate for our needs! - that, in addition to 'fragmented' (as in fraction or refraction), `fractus` should also mean 'irregular,' both meanings being preserved in fragment"

> [!QUOTE] Every `set`[^1] with a non-integer (Hausdorff-Besicovitch) dimension (D) is a `fractal`. However not every `fractal` has an integer $D$. A `fractal` is by definition a `set`[^1] for which $D$ strictly exceeds the topological dimension (D^).

## Hausdorff Besicovitch (`Fractal` dimension)

First, we need to understand the `fractal` dimension. So first we have to develop an understanding of “how to calculate the _dimension_ of an object”.

Imagine the 3 different objects:

![[cs602_e_40_1.svg]]  
/// caption  
Dividing the `line`[^2] into $\frac 1 4$. The idea is self similarity.  
///

![[cs602_e_40_2.svg]]  
/// caption  
Dividing the `square` into $\frac 1 4$.  
///

![[cs602_e_40_3.svg]]  
/// caption  
Dividing the `cube` into $\frac 1 4$.  
///

If we pay attention to the pattern common in all three, we immediately see that

$$4 = 4^1$$

$$16 = 4^2$$

$$64 = 4^3$$

This gives us equation

$$N = S^D$$

Here $N$ is the total number of smaller pieces, $S$ is the `scale` of 1 small piece compared to larger piece and $D$ is called the `dimension`.

$$\implies D = \frac {\log N} {\log S}$$

This `dimension` is the `Hausdorff Besicovitch dimension`.

## Koch Curve

![[cs602_e_40_4.svg]]  
/// caption  
An `equilateral triangle` with total length of curve being $3$.  
///

![[cs602_e_40_5.svg]]  
/// caption  
Length is now $4$ .  
///

Continue this process and eventually we will get something like

/// caption

## Fractal Geometry

- For 1 dimensional object (a point on a light), we just need 1 value to describe it.
- For 2 dimensional object (a point on a plane), we need 2 values to describe it.
- For 3 dimensional object (a point in a space), we need 3 values to describe it.

Another mathematical way to define a `dimension` is to look at how `size` of an object increases in relation to increase in 1 dimension. Let $x$ be length in one `dimension` and $2$ be the linear scale.

- For one dimension, $x \implies (2 \times x) \implies 2x$
- For two dimensions, $x \times x \implies (2 \times x) \times (2 \times x) = 4x^2$
- For two dimensions, $x \times x \times x \implies (2 \times x) \times (2 \times x) \times (2 \times x) = 8x^3$

So, in general terms

$$S = L^D$$

Where $S$ is the size, $D$ is the `dimension` and $L$ is the linear scaling factor.

$$\implies D = \frac{\log S}{\log L}$$

In the examples above the value of $D$ is an `integer`, $1, 2$ or $3$, depending on the `dimension` of the geometry. This relationship holds for all `Euclidean shapes`.

## L Systems

The following is based on `L Systems` as described in "Lecture Notes in Biomathematics" by `Przemyslaw Prusinkiewcz` and `James Hanan`.  
A brief description of an `L system` will be presented here but for a more complete description the user should consult the literature.

### Simpleminded Example of `L System`

A string of `characters` (`symbols`) is rewritten on each iteration according to some `replacement rules`. Consider an initial string (`axiom`)  

$$F + F + F + F$$

and a rewriting rule

$$F \to F + F - F - F F + F + F - F$$

After the first iteration, we have

```
F + F - F - F F + F + F - F + F + F - F - F F + F + F - F + F + F - F - F F + F + F - F + F + F - F - F F + F + F - F
```

After the second iteration, we have

```
F + F - F - F F + F + F - F + F + F - F - F F + F + F - F - F + F - F - F F + F + F - F - F + F - F - F F + F + F - F F + F F - F F + F + F - F + F + F - F - F F + F + F - F +  F + F - F - F F + F + F - F - F + F - F - F F + F + F - F + F + F - F F F + F + F - F + F + F - F - F F + F + F - F - F + F - F - F F + F + F - F - F + F - F - F F + F + F - F F + F - F - F F + F + F - F + F + F - F - F F + F + F - F + F + F - F - F F + F + F - F - F + F - F - F F + F + F - F + F + F - F - F F + F + F F + F + F - F - F F + F + F - F - F + F - F - F F + F + F - F - F + F - F - F F + F + F - F F + F - F - F F + F + F - F + F + F - F - F F + F + F - F + F + F - F - F F + F + F - F - F + F - F - F F + F + F - F + F + F - F - F F + F + F - F + F + F - F F F + F + F - F - F + F - F - F F + F + F - F - F + F - F - F F + F + F - F F + F - F - F F + F + F - F + F + F - F - F F + F + F - F + F + F - F - F F + F + F - F - F + F - F - F F + F + F - F 
```

The graphical meaning for this is

- `F` means move forward
- `+` means turn right
- `-` means turn left

## `IFS` - Iterated Function Systems

Instead of working with lines as in `L systems`, `IFS` replaces polygons by other polygons as described by a generator. On every iteration each polygon is replaced by a suitably scaled, rotated, and translated version of the polygons in the generator.

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
	x_n \\
	y_n
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
	a & b \\
	c & d \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
	x_{n - 1} \\
	y_{n - 1}
\end{bmatrix}
+
\begin{bmatrix}
	e \\
	f
\end{bmatrix}
$$

To run the system an `initial point` is chosen and on each iteration one of the transformation is chosen randomly according to the assigned probabilities, the resulting points $(x_n, y_n)$ are drawn on the page.  
As in the case of [L systems](#l-systems), if the `IFS code` for a desired image can be determined (by something called the `Collage theorem`) then large data compression ratios can be achieved.  
The fundamental iterative process involves replacing rectangles with a series of rectangles called the `generator`. The rectangles are replaced by a suitably scaled, translated, and rotated version of the `generator`.

$$x_{n + 1} \leftarrow f(x_n, y_n)$$

$$y_{n + 1} \leftarrow f(x_n, y_n)$$
