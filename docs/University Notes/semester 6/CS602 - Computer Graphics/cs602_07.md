## Ellipse

Ellipse

$$|\overline{O V_2}| = |\overline{O V_1}| = a$$

$$|\overline{O V_2^\prime}| = |\overline{O V_1^\prime}| = b$$

$$|\overline{O F_2}| = |\overline{O F_1}| = c$$

$$|r_1 + r_2| = 2c$$

### History

- The [ellipse](#ellipse) was first studied by `Menaechmus`.
- It was further investigated by `Euclid` and later named by `Apollonius`.
- The concepts of `focus` and `conic section directrix` of an [ellipse](#ellipse) were studied by `Pappus`.
- In `1602`, `Kepler` believed that the orbit of `Mars` was oval.
- He later discovered it was an [ellipse](#ellipse) with the `Sun` at one `focus`.
- `Kepler` introduced the word `"focus"` and published his findings in `1609`.
- In `1705`, `Halley` showed that the comet now named after him follows an `elliptical orbit` around the `Sun`.
- An [ellipse](#ellipse) rotated about its `minor axis` gives an _oblate spheroid_.
- An [ellipse](#ellipse) rotated about its `major axis` gives a _prolate spheroid_.

$$\frac {x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$$

Assuming $a > b$, $b$ is called the `semi minor axis` and $a$ is called the `semi major axis`.  
In general,  
Equation of an [ellipse](#ellipse) centered at $(x_0, y_0)$ is

$$\frac {(x - x_0)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y - y_0)^2}{b^2} = 1$$

## Ellipse Drawing Techniques

$$\frac {x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$$

$$\implies b^2x^2 + a^2 y^2 = a^2b^2$$

$$f_{\text{ellipse}} = b^2x^2 + a^2 y^2 - a^2b^2$$

Let's assume $a > b$ and accordingly, $r_x = a$ and $r_y = b$.  

$$f_{\text{ellipse}} = r_y^2x^2 + r_x^2 y^2 - r_x^2r_y^2$$

$$f_{\text{ellipse}} = 
\begin{cases}
	< 0 & \text{if } (x, y) \text{ is inside the ellipse boundary} \\
	= 0 & \text{if } (x, y) \text{ is on the ellipse boundary} \\
	> 0 & \text{if } (x, y) \text{ is outside the ellipse boundary} \\
\end{cases}
$$

Starting from $(0, r_y)$, we step using $x$ where $y$ is determined by `decision function`.  
When `slope`[^1] $m = -1$, we switch the stepping from $x$ to $y$.  
The `slope`[^1] of the [ellipse](#ellipse) can be figured out by using  

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = - \frac{r_y^2x^2}{r_x^2y^2}$$

The boundary where we switch stepping, is determined by $\frac {dy}{dx} = -1$.  
This gives us  

$$r_y^2x^2 = r_x^2y^2$$

we will switch the stepping whenever  

$$r_y^2x^2 \ge r_x^2y^2$$

Similar to [[cs602_06|previous lecture]], for region 1, if $P_k < 0$ then $y_{k + 1} = yk$ otherwise, $y_{k + 1} = y_k - 1$.  

$$P_{k + 1} = P_k + 2r_y^2(x_k + 1) + r_y^2 \quad \text{where } P_k < 0$$

$$P_{k + 1} = P_k + 2r_y^2(x_k + 1) + r_y^2 - 2r_x^2(y_k - 1)\quad \text{where } P_k > 0$$

For our stating point $P_0$, we will put $(0, r_y)$,  

$$P_0 = r_y^2 - r_x^2r_y + \frac 1 4 r_x^2$$

Similarly, for region 2  

$$P_{k + 1}^\prime = P_k^\prime - 2 r_x^2(y_k + 1) + r_x^2 \quad \text{where } P_k^\prime > 0$$

$$P_{k + 1}^\prime = P_k^\prime + 2 r_y^2(x_k + 1) + r_x^2 - 2r_x^2y_k \quad \text{where } P_k^\prime < 0$$

Our starting point $P_0^\prime$ will be the last point computed in region 1.  

$$P_0^\prime = r_y^2 \left(x_0 + \frac 1 2\right) + r_x^2(y_0 - 1)^2 - r_x^2r_y^2$$

```js
MidPointEllipse(xcenter, ycenter, rx, ry):
	x = 0
	y = ry

	do {
		DrawSymmetricPoints (xcenter, ycenter, x, y)
		
		R1_P0 = ry**2 - rx**2 * ry + rx**2 * 1 / 4

		if (R1_Pk < 0) {
			R1_Pk_next = R1_Pk + 2ry**2 * (xk + 1) + ry**2
		}
		else {
			R1_Pk_next = R1_Pk + 2ry**2 * (xk + 1) + ry**2 - 2rx**2 * (yk - 1)
		}
		
		R2_P0 = ry**2 * (x0 + 1 / 2) + rx**2 * (y0 - 1)**2 - rx**2 * ry**2
		
		y++

		if (R2_Pk > 0) {
			R2_Pk_next = R2_PK - 2rx**2 * (yk + 1) + rx**2
		}
		else {
			R2_Pk_next = R2_PK - 2rx**2 * yk + rx**2 + 2ry**2 (xk + 1)
		}
		x++
	} while (ry**2 * x**2 >= rx**2 * y**2);
}
```

## Hyperbola

`Set`[^4] of all points, whose difference of distances from 2 fixed points (the `foci`) is constant, is called a `hyperbola`.

![[cs602_e_7_2.svg]]{id="hyperbola_img"}  
/// caption  
(Rough sketch of a) `hyperbola` with `center` $O$, `foci` ($F_1, F_2$) and `vertices` ($V_1, V_2$).  
///  

$$\overline{V_1V_2} = \text{Transverse Axis}$$

### Equation

#### Horizontal Transverse Axis

> [!NOTE]- Centered at $(0, 0)$  
> 
> $$\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$$

> [!NOTE]- Centered at $(h, k)$  
> 
> $$\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1$$

#### Vertical Transverse Axis

> [!NOTE]- Centered at $(0, 0)$  
> 
> $$\frac{y^2}{a^2} - \frac{x^2}{b^2} = 1$$

> [!NOTE]- Centered at $(h, k)$  
> 
> $$\frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2} = 1$$

If $c = |\overline{FO}|$ and $a = |\overline{VO}|$ then

$$b^2 = c^2 - a^2$$

`Eccentricity` $e$ is given by  

$$e = \frac c a$$

> [!NOTE] For `hyperbola`, $e > 1$ and for [ellipse](#ellipse), $1 \ge e > 0$

The coordinates of the corners of the `rectangle` shown in the [figure](#hyperbola_img) are  

$$(h \pm a, k \pm b)$$

and the dotted lines passing through these corners are called `asymptotes`, bounding both branches of the `hyperbola`.

`Slope`[^1] is given by  

$$\frac b a$$

The equations for the `asymptotes` are  

> [!NOTE]- For horizontal `hyperbola`  
> 
> $$y = k \pm \frac b a (x - h)$$

> [!NOTE]- For vertical `hyperbola`  
> 
> $$y = k \pm \frac a b (x - h)$$

Also, the `line`[^5] joining both ends of the `rectangle`, passing through the `center` and perpendicular to the `axis` is called `conjugate axis`.

## Parabola

It is defined as `set`[^4] of `points` which are equidistant from a `line`[^5] called `directrix` and a fixed point called `focus` which isn't on `directrix`.  
The midpoint between `directrix` and `focus` is called the `vertex`.  
The line passing through `focus` and `vertex` is called the `axis`.

> [!NOTE] Although `parabola` looks like one of the branches of [hyperbola](#hyperbola), it is not quite the case.

Equations for `parabolas` with `vertex` at $(h, k)$ are given by

> [!NOTE]- For horizontal `parabola`  
> 
> $$(y - k)^2 = 4p(x - h)$$

> [!NOTE]- For vertical `parabola`  
> 
> $$(x - h)^2 = 4p(y - k)$$

## Rotations of Axes

The $B$ term in the general equation

$$Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$$

controls rotation.

### Animated Applications

[Ellipses](#ellipse), [hyperbolas](#hyperbola) and [parabolas](#parabola) are useful for describing orbital motions in context of following `forces`.

- Gravitational
- Electromagnetic
- Nuclear

### Parabolic Reflectors

- Car headlights
- Telescope mirrors
- Antennas

### Elliptical Orbits

Sun being one of the `foci` was noted by `Apollonius` in 2nd century and was later studied by `Kepler` rigorously.  
The `eccentricity` of the following orbits are

- $0.0167$ for `earth`
- $0.2481$ for `pluto` (highest in all planets)

### Whispering Galleries

In United States capital, `St. Paul's Cathedral` has one of the rooms with an elliptical ceiling which allows two people standing at different `foci` of the `ellipse` hear each other very closely.

### Polynomials and Spline Curves

$$y = \sum_{i = 0}^n a_ix^i$$

$$y = a_0x^0 + a_1x^1 + \ldots + a_nx^n$$

Applications involve

- Design of object shapes
- Specifications of animation paths
- Graphing of data trends in a discrete set of data points

To design object shapes or motion paths, a few key points are chosen to outline the curve, then polynomial fitting is applied.  
A common approach uses `cubic polynomial segments` between each pair of points, defined parametrically as:

$$x(u)=ax0+ax1u+ax2u2+ax3u3x(u) = a_{x0} + a_{x1}u + a_{x2}u^2 + a_{x3}u^3$$

$$y(u)=ay0+ay1u+ay2u2+ay3u3y(u) = a_{y0} + a_{y1}u + a_{y2}u^2 + a_{y3}u^3$$

where $u \in [0,1]u \in [0, 1]$.
