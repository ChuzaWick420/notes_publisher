$$|\overline{O V_2}| = |\overline{O V_1}| = a$$

$$|\overline{O V_2^\prime}| = |\overline{O V_1^\prime}| = b$$

$$|\overline{O F_2}| = |\overline{O F_1}| = c$$

$$|r_1 + r_2| = 2c$$

### History

- The [ellipse](#ellipse) was first studied by `Menaechmus`.
- It was further investigated by `Euclid` and later named by `Apollonius`.
- The concepts of `focus` and `conic section directrix` of an [ellipse](#ellipse) were studied by `Pappus`.
- In `1602`, `Kepler` believed that the orbit of `Mars` was oval.
- He later discovered it was an [ellipse](#ellipse) with the `Sun` at one `focus`.
- `Kepler` introduced the word `"focus"` and published his findings in `1609`.
- In `1705`, `Halley` showed that the comet now named after him follows an `elliptical orbit` around the `Sun`.
- An [ellipse](#ellipse) rotated about its `minor axis` gives an _oblate spheroid_.
- An [ellipse](#ellipse) rotated about its `major axis` gives a _prolate spheroid_.

$$\frac {x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$$

Assuming $b< a$, $b$ is called the `semi minor axis` and $a$ is called the `semi major axis`.  
In general,  
Equation of an [ellipse](#ellipse) centered at $(x_0, y_0)$ is

$$\frac {(x - x_0)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y - y_0)^2}{b^2} = 1$$

## Ellipse Drawing Techniques

$$\frac {x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$$

$$\implies b^2x^2 + a^2 y^2 = a^2b^2$$

$$f_{\text{ellipse}} = b^2x^2 + a^2 y^2 - a^2b^2$$

Let's assume $a > b$ and accordingly, $r_x = a$ and $r_y = b$.  

$$f_{\text{ellipse}} = r_y^2x^2 + r_x^2 y^2 - r_x^2r_y^2$$

$$f_{\text{ellipse}} = 
\begin{cases}
	< 0 & \text{if } (x, y) \text{ is inside the circle boundary} \\
	= 0 & \text{if } (x, y) \text{ is on the circle boundary} \\
	> 0 & \text{if } (x, y) \text{ is outside the circle boundary} \\
\end{cases}
$$

Starting from $(0, r_y)$, we step using $x$ where $y$ is determined by `decision function`.  
When `slope`[^1] $m = -1$, we switch the stepping from $x$ to $y$.  
The `slope`[^1] of the [ellipse](#ellipse) can be figured out by using  

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = - \frac{r_y^2x^2}{r_x^2y^2}$$

The boundary where we switch stepping, is determined by $\frac {dy}{dx} = -1$.  
This gives us  

$$r_y^2x^2 = r_x^2y^2$$

we will switch the stepping whenever  

$$r_y^2x^2 \ge r_x^2y^2$$

Similar to [[cs602_06|previous lecture]], for region 1, if $P_k < 0$ then $y_{k + 1} = yk$ otherwise, $y_{k + 1} = y_k - 1$.  

$$P_{k + 1} = P_k + 2r_y^2(x_k + 1) + r_y^2 \quad \text{where } P_k < 0$$

$$P_{k + 1} = P_k + 2r_y^2(x_k + 1) + r_y^2 - 2r_x^2(y_k - 1)\quad \text{where } P_k > 0$$

For our stating point $P_0$, we will put $(0, r_y)$,  

$$P_0 = r_y^2 - r_x^2r_y + \frac 1 4 r_x^2$$

Similarly, for region 2  

$$P_{k + 1}^\prime = P_k^\prime - 2 r_x^2(y_k + 1) + r_x^2 \quad \text{where } P_k^\prime > 0$$

$$P_{k + 1}^\prime = P_k^\prime + 2 r_y^2(x_k + 1) + r_x^2 - 2r_x^2y_k \quad \text{where } P_k^\prime < 0$$

Our starting point $P_0$ will be the last point computed in region 1.  

$$P_0 = r_y^2 \left(x_0 + \frac 1 2\right) + r_x^2(y_0 - 1)^2 - r_x^2r_y^2$$

```cpp
void MidPointEllipse(int xcenter, int ycenter, int rx, int ry) {
	int x = 0;
	int y = ry;

	do {
		DrawSymmetricPoints (xcenter, ycenter, x, y);
		
	} while (2 * pow(ry, 2) * pow(x, 2) >= 2 * (rx, 2) * (y, 2));
}
```
