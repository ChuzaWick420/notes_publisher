## Mathematics of Color in Computer Graphics

A `color` can be represented by either a 3D `vector`[^1] (`rgb`) or 4D `vector`[^1] (`rgba`). The values can be represented within a range $[0, 1]$.  
A `24 bit` display has $24$ bits to use for `colors`.  

$$\frac {24 \text{ bits}} {3 \text{ colors}} = 8 \text{ bits per color}$$

This is generally called _true color_ because $256^3 = 16.7 M$ is the total number of `colors` your eyes can discern.

## Representing the `Colors`

```c
struct color3 {
	float r, g, b;
};
```

```c
struct color3 {
	float r, g, b;
	float a; // Alpha channel for transparency
};
```

> [!NOTE] $r, g$ and $b$ _must_ be within $[0, 1]$.

The `gamut` is the physical range of colors a monitor can display.

> Printers usually use HSV (hue, saturation and value) `color spaces`.

## Why We Might want `128-BIT Color`

`Mike Abrash` (`1992`) recounts a shift from `256-color` palettes to hardware supporting `16 million colors` and questions how we’d use them all. He cites `Sheldon Linker`’s story from the `1970s`, where JPL printed text with background colors differing by a single index. Surprisingly, the words were still readable—our eyes are highly sensitive to subtle color changes. On screens, however, only ~`16 million colors` were distinguishable, showing that the eye perceives reflected light (print) better than emissive light (monitors). The takeaway: human vision is precise, and `24-bit color` isn't as much as it seems—round-off errors matter.

## Multiplying `Color` Values

The calculation of `color` of a particular `pixel`[^2] depends upon

- Surface's material properties
- `Color` of ambient light (`lighting model`)
- Light shining on the surface
- Scattering surfaces (e.g. `fog`) between `viewport` and the `surface`

### Example

Let there be a light source of `lime green color` $c_l = (0.34765, 0.92578, 0.24609)$ and a surface of `magenta color` $c_s = (0.86719, 0.00000, 0.98828)$.  

$$c_l \otimes c_s = (0.34765, 0.92578, 0.24609) \otimes (0.86719, 0.00000, 0.98828)$$

$$= (0.34765 \times 0.86719, 0.92578 \times 0.00000, 0.24609 \times 0.98828)$$

$$= (0.30148, 0.00000, 0.243210)$$

Because the values themselves are below $1$, therefore, we lose `light intensity` with each operation.

## Dealing with `Saturated Colors`

$$C_1 = (1.0,0.49,0.0) \text{ and } C_2 = (0.0,1.0,0.49)$$

$$C = C_1 + C_2 = (1.0, 1.49, 0.49)$$

This `color` exceeds the range that the hardware can display.  
There are 3 approaches to solve this.

- Clamp the `color` within the $[0, 1]$ range but at cost of shifting the color.
- Scale down the `color` by its larger component but reducing the intensity.
- Clip the intense color components and increase the other components to maintain intensity.
