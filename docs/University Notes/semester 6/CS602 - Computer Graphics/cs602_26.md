# 26. Mathematics of Lighting and Shading part 2

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 01-07-2025</span>

## Light Types

### Parallel or Directional Lights

These are used to simulate `sun` (93 million miles) and makes math easy. The `attenuation` factor is always $1$ (for `point` or `spotlights`, it generally involves `divisions` if not `square roots`). Because they are simpler, the frame rates remain reasonably high enough.

### Point Lights

These are one step better than [parallel lights](#parallel-or-directional-lights) and we have `intensity falloff` as

$$\text{Attenuation Factor} = \frac k {d^2}$$

$$\text{where }d = |\text{surface location} - \text{light location}|^2$$

$$\vec l + \vec L = \vec s$$

$$\vec L = \vec s - \vec l$$

$$|L| \hat L = \vec s - \vec l$$

$$\hat L = \frac {\vec s - \vec l} {|L|}$$

$$\hat L = \frac {\vec s - \vec l} {|\vec s - \vec l|}$$

$$\text{light direction} = \frac{\text{surface location} - \text{light location}}{|\text{surface location} - \text{light location}|}$$

### Spotlights

These should be avoided and are not for real time environment.

The light from inner cone to the outer cone has a _linear fade out_ effect (i.e. the intensity depends upon how close a point is to the inner cone).

## Shading Models

### Lambert

`Triangles` that use `Lambertian shading` are painted with one solid color instead of using a gradient. To light a `triangle`, you compute the lighting equations using the `triangle`'s normal and any of the three vertices of the `triangle`.

### Gouraud

`Gouraud` (pronounced _garrow_) shading is the current de facto shading standard in accelerated 3D hardware. Instead of specifying one `color` to use for the entire triangle, each `vertex` has its own separate `color`. The `color` values are linearly interpolated across the triangle, creating a smooth transition between the `vertex` `color` values. To calculate the lighting for a `vertex`, we use the position of the `vertex` and a `vertex` `normal`.[^1]

/// caption  
Flat Shading vs Gouraud

One problem with `Gouraud shading` is that the `triangles`' `intensities` can never be greater than the `intensities` at the edges. So if there is a [spotlight](#spotlights) shining directly into the center of a large `triangle`, `Gouraud shading` will interpolate the `intensities` at the three dark corners, resulting in an incorrectly dark `triangle`.

### Phong

`Phong` is relatively more realistic as it makes `highlights` on the surface (i.e. shininess). The way `Phong` does this is by interpolating the `normal`[^1] across the `triangle` face, not the `color` value, and the lighting equation is solved individually for each `pixel`.[^2]
