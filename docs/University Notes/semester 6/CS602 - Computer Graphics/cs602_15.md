# 15. Clipping - 2

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 13-05-2025</span>

## Polygon Clipping

### Sutherland-hodgman's Polygon-clipping Algorithm

This algorithm uses `divide and conquer` design.

#### Notes

- `Polygons` are clipped against each `edge` of the `window` at a time.
- `Vertices` which are clipped, are saved for clipping against other `window edges`.
- Number of `vertices` will often change.
- Using divide and conquer approach.

### Cases of Polygon Clipping against One Edge

- Both `vertices` of the `edge` are fully inside the visible region.
- Both `vertices` of the `edge` are fully outside the visible region.
- One `vertex` is inside the visible region and the `edge` exits.
- One `vertex` is outside the visible region and the `edge` enters.

### Pipeline Clipping Approach

`Vertices` are clipped against each window boundary in sequence.  
For each `vertex`, intersections are calculated and passed along if the edge crosses a boundary; points inside are passed directly.  
Surviving points are added to the output.  
Arrays `s` and `firstPoint` track the last and first clipped points for each boundary, with a final step to close the `polygon`.

### Shortcoming of Sutherlands -hodgeman Algorithm

The `Sutherland-Hodgman` algorithm clips `convex polygons` correctly but can produce extraneous lines for `concave polygons`, as it always connects the last and first `vertices`.  
Solutions include splitting `concave polygons` into `convex` parts, checking for multiple intersections along boundaries, or using more advanced algorithms like `Weiler-Atherton`.

### Weiler-atherton Polygon Clipping

The `Weiler-Atherton` algorithm modifies `vertex` processing to correctly clip `concave polygons` by following either `polygon` edges or window boundaries, based on `vertex` direction (clockwise/counterclockwise) and whether `vertices` go from outside to inside or vice versa.  
This allows accurate clipping for arbitrary regions and was designed for visible surface detection.
