# 16. 3D Concepts

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 13-05-2025</span>

## Coordinate Systems

These are measured frames of references in which geometry is

- Defined
- Manipulated
- Viewed

### 1D Coordinate System

- `Origin` as reference and has direction and magnitude along a single axis.
- Locations are defined by a single coordinate.
- Can define 
	- `points`
	- `segments`
	- `lines`
	- `rays`

### 2D Coordinate System

- `Origin` as reference and has direction and magnitude along 2 axes.
- Locations are defined by coordinate pair $(x, y)$.
- Can define
	- `curves`
	- `polygons`
	- 1D entities

### 3D Coordinate System

- `Origin` as reference and has direction and magnitude along 3 axes.
- Locations are defined by coordinate triplet $(x, y, z)$.
- Can define
	- `cubes`
	- `cones`
	- `spheres` 
	- Volumes in space
	- 1D and 2D entities

## Left-handed versus Right-handed

/// caption  
Right Hand

Mostly the [right handed rule](#right-hand) is used but cameras use [left handed rule](#left-hand).

### Professional Choices

## Global Vs Local Coordinates

- Local coordinates are relative to the object
- Global coordinates are relative to the world

## Multiple Frames of Reference within a 3D Scene

## Defining Points in `C`

```c
typedef struct {
	float x;
	float y;
	float z;
} Point3D;
```

## The Polar Coordinate System

These are generally not used in 3D graphics because the math is often harder and these are hard to manipulate comparatively.

## Defining Geometry in 3D

### Modeling

It is the process of describing an `object` or `scene` so that we can construct an image of it.

### Primitives

These are fundamental geometric entities within a given `data structure`.

- `Points`
- `Vectors`[^1]
- `Polygons`
- `Polygon strips`
- `Meshes`

Meshes provide continuity across surfaces which is important for shading calculations.

## Rendering

It is the process of constructing an image, using a combination of 

- A 3D database
- Scene characteristics
- Viewing transformations

Different algorithms are employed for different `rendering` applications.

## Tessellation

It is the process of dividing an `entity` or `surface` into multiple disjoint `primitives`.  
`Renderers` typically decompose `surfaces` into `triangles` as part of the `rendering` process.

## Sampling

The process of selecting a representative but finite number of values along a `continuous function`[^2] sufficient to render a reasonable approximation of the function for the task at hand.

### Level of Detail (LOD)

Depending on the importance of a certain entity in the image, different versions (varying in details) of a `model` can be swapped out dynamically from the `scene database`.

## Surface Models

These can be constructed from the mathematical descriptions.

## Meta Balls (blobs)

Potential `functions`[^3] (usually radially `symmetric Gaussian functions`) are used to define surfaces surrounding `points`.
