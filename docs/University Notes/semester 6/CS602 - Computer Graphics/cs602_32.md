# Introduction to `OpenGL`

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 03-07-2025</span>

As a software interface for graphics hardware, `OpenGL` renders multidimensional objects into a `frame buffer`.[^1] `OpenGL` is industry-standard graphics software with which programmers can create high-quality still and animated three-dimensional color images.

## Where Applicable

It is built for compatibility across hardware and operating systems, making it easy to port across different operating systems (i.e. `Linux` and `Windows`). It is designed for use by `C` and `C++` programmers.

> [!NOTE] It is introduced since $1992$.

## Developer Driven Advantages

### Industry Standard

An independent consortium, the `OpenGL Architecture Review Board`, guides the `OpenGL` specification. With broad industry support, `OpenGL` is the only truly open, vendor-neutral, multiplatform graphics standard.

### Stable

Backward compatibility requirements ensure that existing applications do not become obsolete.

### Reliable and Portable

All `OpenGL` applications produce consistent visual display results on any `OpenGL` API-compliant hardware, regardless of operating system or windowing system.

### Evolving

Because of its thorough and forward-looking design, `OpenGL` allows new hardware innovations to be accessible through the API via the `OpenGL` extension mechanism. In this way, innovations appear in the API in a timely fashion, letting application developers and hardware vendors incorporate new features into their normal product release cycles.

### Scalable

`OpenGL` API-based applications can run on systems ranging from consumer electronics to PCs, workstations, and supercomputers. As a result, applications can scale to any class of machine that the developer chooses to target.

### Easy to Use

`OpenGL` is well structured with an intuitive design and logical commands. Efficient `OpenGL` routines typically result in applications with fewer lines of code than those that make up programs generated using other graphics libraries or packages. In addition, `OpenGL` drivers encapsulate information about the underlying hardware, freeing the application developer from having to design for specific hardware features.

### Well Documented

Numerous books have been published about `OpenGL`, and a great deal of sample code is readily available, making information about `OpenGL` inexpensive and easy to obtain.

## Simplifies Software Development, Speeds Time-to-market

From graphics primitives like `point` and `lines` to complex `lighting` and texture mapped curved surfaces, `OpenGL` provides `functions` with different standard abiding bindings for languages like

- `C`
- `C++`
- `Java`
- `Fortran`
- `Ada`

This increases the developer productivity, decreasing the time to markets.

## Available Everywhere

`OpenGL` runs on every major `operating system` including 

- `Mac OS`
- `OS/2`
- `UNIX`
- `Windows 95`
- `Windows 98`
- `Windows 2000`
- `Windows NT`
- `Linux`
- `OPENStep`
- `BeOS`

## Architected for Flexibility and Differentiation

Using the `OpenGL` extension mechanism, hardware developers can differentiate their products by developing extensions that allow software developers to access additional performance and technological innovations.

The following topics present a global view of how OpenGL works:

### Primitives and Commands

Discusses

- Points
- Line segments
- Polygons
- Processing of commands

A `vertex` defines a `point` which is the endpoint of a `line` or a corner of `polygon` where two `edges` meet. Each `vertex` also has some data associated with it such as

- `vertex` `coordinates`
- `colors`
- `normals`[^2]
- `texture coordinates`
- `edge flags`

Commands are always processed in the order in which they are received.

### `OpenGL` Graphic Control

Provides some graphics operations such as

- `Transformation matrices`[^3]
- Lighting equation coefficients
- Antialiasing methods
- `Pixel`[^4] update operators

However, it doesn't provide you means to describe or model a complex geometric object. `OpenGL` is procedural rather than descriptive.

### Execution Model

The client application can issue commands which are interpreted by `OpenGL` (the server) which could possibly run on a different hardware. This makes `OpenGL` network transparent.  
A server maintains several `OpenGL contexts` each of which is an encapsulated `OpenGL state`. A `client` can connect to any of these `contexts`.  

The window system:

- Determines which portions of the `frame buffer`[^1] `OpenGL` may access at any given time.
- Communicates to `OpenGL` how those portions are structured.

`Frame buffer`[^1] configuration is done outside of `OpenGL` in conjunction with the `window` system. `OpenGL` initialization takes place when the `window` system allocates a `window` for `OpenGL` rendering.

### Basic `OpenGL` Operation

Gives a high-level description of how `OpenGL` processes data to produce a corresponding image in the `frame buffer`.[^1]

#### Display List

Rather than having all commands proceed immediately through the pipeline, you can choose to accumulate some of them in a display list for processing later.

#### Evaluator

The evaluator stage of processing provides an efficient way to approximate curve and surface geometry by evaluating polynomial commands of input values.

#### Per-vertex Operations and Primitive Assembly

`OpenGL` processes geometric primitives such as 

- `points`
- `line segments`
- `polygons`  

all of which are described by `vertices`.  
`Vertices` are transformed and lit, and primitives are clipped to the viewport in preparation for `rasterization`.

#### Rasterization

The `rasterization` stage produces a series of `frame buffer addresses` and associated values using a two-dimensional description of a 

- `point`
- `line segment`
- `polygon`  

Each fragment so produced is fed into the last stage, `per fragment` operations.

#### Per Fragment Operations

These are the final operations performed on the data before it is stored as `pixels`[^4] in the `framebuffer`.[^1]

---

Following pixel operations, the pixel data is either:

- Stored as `texture memory`, for use in the `rasterization` stage.
- Rasterized, with the resulting fragments merged into the `framebuffer`[^1] just as if they were generated from geometric data.
