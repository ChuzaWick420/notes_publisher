# 08. Filled Area Primitive 1

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 22-04-2025</span>

There are two approaches

## Scan-line Polygon Fill

### Polygon

A `polygon` can be defined as a shape that is formed by `line segments`[^1] that are placed end to end, creating a continuous closed path.

#### Types

##### Convex

These are simplest to fill.  
`Convex polygon` edges do not intersect each other, meaning if we were to draw a `line`[^1] connecting two internal `points`, the `line`[^1] won't intersect any `edge`.

![[cs602_e_8_1.svg]]  
/// caption

##### Concave

These are `superset`[^2] of [convex](#convex) polygons.  
They may have `points`, which when connected by a `line`[^1] segment, cross `edges` of the [polygon](#polygon).

![[cs602_e_8_2.svg]]  
/// caption

///

##### Complex

These are self intersecting [concave polygons](#concave).  
Complexity arises from the fact that we cannot tell which side is the above or below during filling process.

### Difference between Filled and Unfilled Polygon

For the unfilled [polygons](#polygon), we only have to consider the `perimeter` but for the `filled` [polygons](#polygon), we also have to consider the `pixels`[^3] within its boundaries.

![[cs602_e_8_4.svg]]

To determine which `pixels`[^3] are inside the [polygon](#polygon), we use the `odd parity` rule within the `scan line polygon fill algorithm`.

### Parity

Take a `point` $O$ outside of the [polygon](#polygon), then draw a `line`[^1] to another `point` $P$ which needs to be determined if it lies within the [polygon](#polygon) or not.  
If this `line`[^1] intersects `odd` number of `edges` then the `point` is inside the [polygon](#polygon), otherwise it is outside.

#### Using the Odd Parity Test in the Polygon Fill Algorithm

This introduces the problem that how do we determine if our starting `point` $O$ is outside or inside the [polygon](#polygon) to begin with.  
Therefore, at the start of our `scan line`, we will start with `even parity`.  
As we cross the `edges`, this `parity` alternates between `odd` and `even`.  
Depending on that, we can turn on the filling mode.

### Polygon Filling

Our target is to develop an `algorithm` which is general and works for all 3 types of [polygons](#polygon).  
Since [complex polygon](#complex) is a `superset`[^2] of other two, if our algorithm works for [complex polygons](#complex) then the problem is solved.

### Scan line

A `scan line` is a `line`[^1] of the form $y = c$ where $c$ lies within our drawing region, which is our `window`.

### Algorithm

To start with, we will most likely be given a `set`[^2] of `vertices` of the [polygons](#polygon) in `Cartesian coordinates`.

#### Initializing All of the Edges

The `all_edges` table will hold information regarding which `vertices` are related to which `edges`.

An `edge` is a pair of successive `vertices` such as $(1, 2)$ and $(2, 3)$ etc.  
The information for each `edge` that is stored in the table is following

- The maximum $y$ value of both `vertices`.
- The minimum $y$ value of both `vertices`.
- The $x$ value associated with minimum $y$ value.
- The `slope`[^1] of the `edge`.

The `slope`[^1] can be calculated by

- $y_0 =$ maximum $y$ value  
- $y_1 =$ minimum $y$ value  
- $x_0 =$ maximum $x$ value  
- $x_1 =$ minimum $x$ value  

$$m = \text{slope} = \frac{y_0 - y_1}{x_0 - x_1}$$

| Edge Index | Y min    | Y max    | X val    | 1/m      |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 0          | 10       | 16       | 10       | 0        |
| 1          | 16       | 20       | 10       | 1.5      |
| $\vdots$   | $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ |
| N          | 10       | 16       | 28       | 0        |

#### Initializing the Global Edge Table

Since we are filling from bottom to top, the `global edge table` has to keep the `edges` with `Y min` in ascending order.  
Also, since we are filling from left to right, the index increases when `Y min` was same (same height) but `X val` is increasing (suggesting this `edge` is on the right side in comparison to other edge).  
Ignore the horizontal `edges` with $m = 0$.

| Edge Index | Y min    | Y max    | X val    | 1/m      |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 0          | 10       | 16       | 10       | 0        |
| 1          | 10       | 16       | 28       | 0        |
| $\vdots$   | $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ |
| N          | 16       | 20       | 10       | 1.5      |

#### Initializing Parity

The initial `parity` is `even` since no `edges` have been crossed yet.

#### Initializing the Scan-line

Due to the fact that `global edges table` is sorted, the [scan line](#scan-line) is initialized with `Y min` of first entry, as it is the lowest `point`.

#### Initializing the Active Edge Table

This keeps track of `edges` which are intersected by the current [scan line](#scan-line).  
We will keep adding the `edges` with same `Y min` value until we reach a `Y min` value that is greater than the [scan line](#scan-line) value.

| Edge Index | Y max    | X val    | 1/m      |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 0          | 16       | 10       | 0        |
| 1          | 16       | 28       | 0        |
| $\vdots$   | $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ |
| N          | 16       | 10       | 1.5      |

#### Filling the Polygon

- Draw all `pixels`[^3] as long as `parity` is `odd`, for all $x$ values.
- Increase the [scan line](#scan-line) by $1$.
- Remove any `edge` from the `active edge table` which has `Y max` value, equal to the [scan line](#scan-line) value, implying that this `edge` has been drawn.
- Update the $x$ value for each `edge` in the table using formula $x_1 = x_0 + \frac 1 m$.
- If the [scan line](#scan-line) value is equal to `Y min` of any `edge` then move that edge from `global edge table` to `active edge table`.
- Reorder the `edges` according to their increasing $x$ value.

#### Special Cases

##### Horizontal Edges

As we know, these lines are excluded from the `global edge table`.  
We will still have the `vertices` and the algorithm will have to allow to draw this `edge` connecting both of the `vertices`.

##### Bottom and Left Edges vs. top and Right Edges

![[cs602_e_8_5.svg]]{id="conflicted-polygons"}  
/// caption  
Blue shows conflicted `pixels`[^3]  
///

Solution is to remove the top horizontal `edges` and right vertical `edges` of both [polygons](#polygon).

![[cs602_e_8_6.svg]]  
/// caption  
The top left of the white [polygon](#polgon) (in this figure) was originally in conflict with the bottom right of the black [polygon](#polygon) from [this figure](#conflicted-polygons).  
This corner from the black [polygon](#polgon) is removed to reveal the white one from beneath.  
///

There are 3 cases where 2 `edges` meet at a `vertex`.  
These affect both whether a `pixel`[^3] is drawn and how `parity` is counted.  

1. Both `edges` meet at `Y min` (the `vertex` is the minimum point for both `edges`)
	- We draw only the left `edge`, since right `edges` are not drawn in the `scan-line fill`.
	- The `pixel`[^3] at the vertex is drawn.
	- `Parity` is counted twice, once for each `edge`.
2. Both `edges` meet at `Y max` (the `vertex` is the maximum point for both `edges`)
	- We don't draw any `edge` at the `vertex`, since max Y points aren't drawn in `scan-line fill`.
	- The `pixel`[^3] at the vertex is not drawn.
	- `Parity` is still counted twice, once for each `edge`.
3. One `edge` has the `vertex` as Y min, the other as Y max (a "bent edge" situation)  
	- If both `edges` are on the left side, the `pixel`[^3] is drawn.
		- It's drawn for the `edge` where the `vertex` is the minimum point (since left edges are drawn).
		- `Parity` is counted once.  
	- If both `edges` are on the right side, the `pixel`[^3] is not drawn.
		- Right `edges` are never drawn.
		- `Parity` is still counted once.

### Example

#### Ordered `Vertices`

| Index |  Vertices  |
| :---: | :--------: |
|   0   | $(10, 10)$ |
|   1   | $(10, 16)$ |
|   2   | $(16, 20)$ |
|   3   | $(28, 10)$ |
|   4   | $(28, 16)$ |
|   5   | $(22, 10)$ |

#### Unfilled

#### Initializing All of the Edges

|     | Y-min | Y-max | X-val | 1/m     |
|-----|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| 0   | $10$  | $16$  | $10$  | $0$     |
| 1   | $16$  | $20$  | $10$  | $1.5$   |
| 2   | $10$  | $20$  | $28$  | $-1.2$  |
| 3   | $10$  | $16$  | $28$  | $0$     |
| 4   | $10$  | $16$  | $22$  | $1$     |
| 5   | $10$  | $10$  | $10$  | $\infty$ |

#### Initializing the Global Edge Table

|     | Y-min | Y-max | X-val | 1/m    |
| --- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------ |
| 0   | $10$  | $16$  | $10$  | $0$    |
| 1   | $10$  | $16$  | $22$  | $1$    |
| 2   | $10$  | $16$  | $28$  | $0$    |
| 3   | $10$  | $20$  | $28$  | $-1.2$ |
| 4   | $16$  | $20$  | $10$  | $1.5$  |

#### Initializing Parity

`Parity` is initially set to `even`.

#### Initializing the [Scan-line](#scan-line)

[Scan-line](#scan-line) is initialized to $10$ as it is the lowest `Y min`.

#### Initializing the Active Edge Table

##### Global Edges Table

|     | Y-min | Y-max | X-val | 1/m   |
| --- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 4   | $16$  | $20$  | $10$  | $1.5$ |

##### Active Edges Table

| Index | Y-max | X-val | 1/m    |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :----- |
| 0     | $16$  | $10$  | $0$    |
| 1     | $16$  | $22$  | $1$    |
| 2     | $16$  | $28$  | $0$    |
| 3     | $20$  | $28$  | $-1.2$ |

#### Filling the Polygon

##### 1. [Scan-line](#scan-line) = 10

At $x = 10$, `parity` becomes `odd` and `points` are drawn until $x = 22$, where `parity` switches to `even`.  
At $x = 28$, a `point` is drawn once due to a special `parity` case.  
The [scan-line](#scan-line) is complete.  
Then, update the `active edge table` using $x_1 = x_0 + \frac{1}{m}$.

| Index | Y-max | X-val  | 1/m    |
| :---- | :---- | :----- | :----- |
| 0     | $16$   | $10$    | $0$     |
| 1     | $16$   | $23$    | $1$     |
| 2     | $16$   | $28$    | $0$     |
| 3     | $20$   | $26.8$  | $-1.2$  |

Reorder the `edges`, as `edge` 3 has a smaller $x$ value than `edge` 2. After reordering, we get:

| Index | Y-max | X-val  | 1/m    |
| :---- | :---- | :----- | :----- |
| 0     | $16$  | $10$   | $0$    |
| 1     | $16$  | $23$   | $1$    |
| 2     | $20$  | $26.8$ | $-1.2$ |
| 3     | $16$  | $28$   | $0$    |

![[cs602_i_8_2.png]]

##### 2. [Scan-line](#scan-line) = 11

Reorder the `edges`, as `edge` 3 has a smaller $x$ value than `edge` 2.  
After reordering, we get

| Index | Y-max | X-val  | 1/m    |
| :---- | :---- | :----- | :----- |
| 0     | $16$  | $10$   | $0$    |
| 1     | $16$  | $24$   | $1$    |
| 2     | $20$  | $25.6$ | $-1.2$ |
| 3     | $16$  | $28$   | $0$    |

![[cs602_i_8_3.png]]

##### 3. [Scan-line](#scan-line) = 12

At $x = 10$, `parity` becomes `odd` and drawing begins.  
At $x = 24$, `parity` switches to `even`.  
At $x = 26$, parity becomes `odd` again, and drawing continues until $x = 28$.  
The [scan-line](#scan-line) is complete.  
Now update the $x$ values in the `active edge table`

| Index | Y-max | X-val  | 1/m    |
| :---- | :---- | :----- | :----- |
| 0     | $16$  | $10$   | $0$    |
| 1     | $16$  | $25$   | $1$    |
| 2     | $20$  | $24.4$ | $-1.2$ |
| 3     | $16$  | $28$   | $0$    |

Reorder the `active edges`, as $x = 24.4$ (index 2) is less than $x = 25$ (index 1). This gives:

| Index | Y-max | X-val  | 1/m    |
| :---- | :---- | :----- | :----- |
| 0     | $16$   | $10$    | $0$     |
| 1     | $20$   | $24.4$  | $-1.2$  |
| 2     | $16$   | $25$    | $1$     |
| 3     | $16$   | $28$    | $0$     |

![[cs602_i_8_4.png]]

##### 4. [Scan-line](#scan-line) = 13

At $x = 10$, `parity` becomes `odd` and drawing starts.  
At $x = 25$, `parity` switches to `even`, then immediately back to `odd`.  
Drawing continues until $x = 28$.  
The [scan-line](#scan-line) is complete.  
Now update the $x$ values in the `active edge table`

| Index | Y-max | X-val  | 1/m    |
| :---- | :---- | :----- | :----- |
| 0     | $16$  | $10$   | $0$    |
| 1     | $20$  | $23.2$ | $-1.2$ |
| 2     | $16$  | $26$   | $1$    |
| 3     | $16$  | $28$   | $0$    |

![[cs602_i_8_5.png]]

##### 5. [Scan-line](#scan-line) = 14

At $x = 10$, `parity` becomes `odd` and drawing begins.  
At $x = 24$, `parity` switches to `even`, then to `odd` at $x = 26$.  
Drawing continues until $x = 28$.  
The [scan-line](#scan-line) is complete.  
Now update the $x$ values in the `active edge table`

| Index | Y-max | X-val | 1/m    |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :----- |
| 0     | $16$  | $10$  | $0$    |
| 1     | $20$  | $22$  | $-1.2$ |
| 2     | $16$  | $27$  | $1$    |
| 3     | $16$  | $28$  | $0$    |

![[cs602_i_8_6.png]]

##### 6. [Scan-line](#scan-line) = 15

At $x = 10$, `parity` becomes `odd` and drawing starts.  
At $x = 22$, `parity` switches to `even`, then to `odd` at $x = 27$.  
Drawing continues until $x = 28$.  
The [scan-line](#scan-line) is complete.  
`Edges` at indices 0, 2, and 3 reach their max y and are removed from the `active edge table`, leaving:

| Index | Y-max | X-val | 1/m    |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :----- |
| 0     | $20$  | $22$  | $-1.2$ |

We then need to update the $x$ values for all remaining `edges`.

| Index | Y-max | X-val  | 1/m    |
| :---- | :---- | :----- | :----- |
| 0     | $20$  | $20.8$ | $-1.2$ |

Add the last `edge` from the `global edge table` to the `active edge table`, as its min y matches the next [scan-line](#scan-line).  
The `active edge table` now becomes: (`global edge table` is empty).

| Index | Y-max | X-val  | 1/m    |
| :---- | :---- | :----- | :----- |
| 0     | $20$  | $20.8$ | $-1.2$ |
| 1     | $20$  | $10$   | $1.5$  |

After reordering:

| Index | Y-max | X-val  | 1/m    |
| :---- | :---- | :----- | :----- |
| 0     | $20$  | $10$   | $1.5$  |
| 1     | $20$  | $20.8$ | $-1.2$ |

![[cs602_i_8_7.png]]

##### 7. [Scan-line](#scan-line) = 16

At $x = 10$, `parity` becomes `odd` and drawing begins until $x = 21$.  
The [scan-line](#scan-line) is complete.  
After updating x values, we get:

| Index | Y-max | X-val  | 1/m    |
| :---- | :---- | :----- | :----- |
| 0     | $20$   | $11.5$    | $1.5$     |
| 1     | $20$   | $19.6$    | $-1.2$     |

![[cs602_i_8_8.png]]

##### 8. [Scan-line](#scan-line) = 17

At $x = 12$, `parity` becomes `odd` and drawing continues until $x = 20$.  
The [scan-line](#scan-line) is complete.  
After updating x values, we get:

| Index | Y-max | X-val  | 1/m    |
| :---- | :---- | :----- | :----- |
| 0     | $20$   | $13$    | $1.5$     |
| 1     | $20$   | $18.4$    | $-1.2$     |

![[cs602_i_8_9.png]]

##### 9. [Scan-line](#scan-line) = 18

At $x = 13$, `parity` becomes `odd` and drawing continues until $x = 19$.  
The [scan-line](#scan-line) is complete.  
After updating x values, we get:

| Index | Y-max | X-val  | 1/m    |
| :---- | :---- | :----- | :----- |
| 0     | $20$   | $14.5$    | $1.5$     |
| 1     | $20$   | $17.2$    | $-1.2$     |

![[cs602_i_8_10.png]]

##### 10. [Scan-line](#scan-line) = 19

At $x = 15$, `parity` becomes `odd` and drawing continues until $x = 18$.  
The [scan-line](#scan-line) is complete.  
Both `edges` reach their max y at the next [scan-line](#scan-line) and are removed.  
The `active edge table` is now empty, and the process is complete.
