## Physically Based Illumination

### Reflection

`Reflection` of a `light wave` is the change in direction of `light` ray when it bounces off the boundary between two media.  

$$\theta_\text{incident} = \theta_\text{reflected}$$

### Refraction

`Refraction` happens when a `light wave` goes from one medium into another. Because of the difference in the speed of `light` of the media, `light` bends when it crosses the boundary. `Snell's law` gives the change in `angles`.

$$n_a \sin(\theta_a) = n_b \sin(\theta_b)$$

Here $n_a$ and $n_b$ are the `refractive indices` of the materials.

> [!NOTE] The `refractive index` of `vacuum` is $1$.

The `critical angle` an an `angle` at which we observe the phenomenon of total `internal reflection`. At any angle greater than this, light will not pass though a boundary but will be reflected internally.

$$\text{red} = 780 - 622 \ nm$$

$$\text{green} = 577 - 492 \ nm$$

$$\text{blue} = 492 - 455 \ nm$$

## Temperature Correction for Refractive Index

$$\eta^t = \eta^x + (x - t)(0.00045)$$

Where $x$ is the given temperature and $t$ is the new temperature for which we are finding the new `refractive index`.
