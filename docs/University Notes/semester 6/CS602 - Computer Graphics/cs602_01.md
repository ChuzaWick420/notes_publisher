# 01. Introduction to Computer Graphics

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 27-03-2025</span>

## Definition

Computers accept process, transform and present information.  
`Computer Graphics` involves technology to accept, process, transform and present information in a visual form that also concerns with producing images (or animations) using a computer.

## Why Should You Study Computer Graphics

### Visualization

Sometimes, when we are doing abstract things, we want to visualize what is happening or we want to help others see the visuals to understand what is happening.

### Graphics is Interesting

We humans admire visuals.

### Requirement

`Computer graphics` is used heavily in areas like

- Machinery
- Architecture

### Entertainment

- Animated cartoons

## Some History

The term “computer graphics” was coined in `1960` by `William Fetter` to describe the new design methods that he was developing at Boeing.  
He created a series of widely reproduced images on a plotter exploring cockpit design using a 3D model of a human body.

## Graphics Applications

- User Interfaces  
- Layout and Design  
- Scientific Visualization and Analysis  
- Art and Design  
- Medicine and Virtual Surgery  
- Layout Design & Architectural Simulations  
- History and cultural heritage
- Entertainment
- Simulations
- Games

### User Interfaces

Many software packages contain a graphical user interface.  
A major component is a window manager which allows display of multiple windows, processes within them and graphical symbols to control parameters etc.

### Scientific Visualization and Analysis

Helps in engineering or medicine for creating models, charts etc.

### Medicine and Virtual Surgery

Extensively used in `tomography` and `simulations of operations`.

#### Tomography

It's a technique the allows cross sectional views of physiological systems in Xray photography.
