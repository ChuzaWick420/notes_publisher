# 25. Mathematics of Lighting and Shading part - 1

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 01-07-2025</span>

## Lights and Materials

`Light` can have following properties

- `Color` (`rgb`)
- Intensity
- Attenuation (a `function`[^1] of `light intensity` where `intensity` decreases as distance from light source increases)
- Shapes
- Positions

`Light` interact with the `material surface` in following ways

- Surface bounce
- Absorption
- Transmission
- Scattering

`Materials` are described using the following colors

- Ambient
- Diffuse
- Specular
- Emissive

> [!NOTE] `Emissive lights` are for objects which generate their own `light` and `ambient` is usually grouped with `specular`.

### Ambient Lighting

It's a global value that is added to each object in the `scene` and is used general environmental illumination. It is the general color of objects due to the global `ambient light` level.

### Diffuse Lighting

It is the `color` of the object due to specific light effect on an object (`matte`). The light is reflected in all directions and depends only on the able between the incident light array and `surface normal`.[^2]

### Specular Lighting

It is the `color` of the highlights on the surface. The specular `light` mimics the shininess of a surface, and its `intensity` is a `function`[^1] of the `light`'s reflection angle off the surface.

### Emissive Lighting

These are lights emitted by the objects themselves. `Shading` is simply calculating the color reflected off a surface (which is pretty much what `shaders` do). When a light reflects off a surface, the light colors are modulated by the surface `color` (typically, the diffuse or ambient surface color).  
Let $l = (r_l, g_l, b_l)$ be the `color` of `light` and $s = (r_s, g_s, b_s)$ be `color` of the `surface` then the resulting `color` is

$$c = l \otimes s$$

$$c = (r_l \times r_s, g_l \times g_s, b_l \times b_s)$$

So a `shader` might typically do the following:

- Calculate the overall [ambient light](#ambient-lighting) on a `surface`.
- For each `light` in a scene, calculate the `diffuse` and `specular contribution` for each `light`.
- Calculate any [emissive light](#emissive-lighting) for a `surface`.
- Add all these `lights` together to calculate the final `color` value.

For `materials` like `metal`(conductive), most of the `light` is reflected and for `dielectrics` (non conductive), most of it is penetrates.  
The dispersion of `light` is a `function`[^1] of the `roughness` of the `surface`.
