## Clamping `Color` Values

`Clamping` is fast, but it tends to lose fidelity in the scene, particularly in areas where we would want and expect subtle changes as the light intensities interact, but end up with those interactions getting eradicated because the differences are all getting clamped out by the graphics hardware.

## Scaling `Color` Values by Intensity

Imagine a `color` $c = (r, g, b)$ with $g > 1$ then, after scaling down other components by the largest, we have  

$$c = \left(\frac r g, \frac g g, \frac b g \right)$$

This reduces `intensity` but maintains `hue` and `saturation`.

## Shifting `Color` Values to Maintain Saturation

### Brightness = Gray Vector

Compute a _gray vector_ in the direction of pure gray (the black–white diagonal of the `RGB cube`). This is something like $(0.6, 0.6, 0.6)$ — a color with no hue but same brightness as the original.

### Preserve Intensity

You want this grayscale vector to have the same `brightness` as the original color.

### Draw a Ray Perpendicular to the Gray

Take the original color and draw a _ray_ from the grayscale vector `perpendicular` to the grayscale direction. This ray represents how saturated the original color was.

### Clip

Extend this ray until it hits the boundaries of the $[0,1]$ `RGB cube`. This gives you a new color that's still inside the valid range but tries to preserve `brightness` and `saturation` as much as possible.

## Negative `Colors` and `Darklights`

`Darklights` are nothing more than lights in which one or more of the color values are negative. `Darklights` can also be used to affect a scene if we want to filter out a specific `rgb` color. If we wanted to get a night vision effect, we could use a `darklight` with negative red and blue values, for example, which would just leave the green channel.

## Alpha Blending

Alpha value determines opaqueness. `0xFF` (`255`) means that the surface is completely `opaque` and `0x00`(`0`) means it is `transparent`.

### Equation

$$\text{Final Color} = \text{source} \times \text{source blend factor} + \text{destination} \times \text{destination blender factor}$$
