# 29. Mathematics of Lighting and Shading part 3

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 01-07-2025</span>

## Traditional 3D Hardware-accelerated Lighting Models

The traditional approach in real time computer graphics has been to calculate `lighting` at a `vertex` as a sum of the `ambient`,[^1] `diffuse`,[^1] and `specular light`.[^1]

$$i_{\text{total}} = k_a \cdot i_a + \sum (k_d \cdot i_d + k_s \cdot i_s)$$

This is called a `local lighting model` since the only `light` on a `vertex` is from a `light source`, not from other objects. The `reflection coefficients` $k$ are in the $[0, 1]$ range and are specified as part of the `material property`.

However, it does fail to take into account any gross `roughness` or anything other than perfect `isotropic reflection`.

### `Ambient`[^1] Light

It is a `light` which comes from all directions (i.e. the environment) but there are too many sources and it would talk a lot of resources to compute so we just have an $x$ value for simplicity and we call it `ambient light`[^1] which equally illuminates all objects.

$$i_a = m_a \otimes s_a$$

Where $i_a$ is `ambient light intensity`, $m_a$ is `ambient material color` and $s_a$ is `light source ambient color`.

### Diffuse light

`Diffuse light`[^1] is the light that is absorbed by a surface and is reflected in all directions. Regardless of the direction from which we view an object with a stationary `diffuse light`[^1] source on it, the brightness of any point on the surface will remain the same. Thus, unlike `ambient light`,[^1] the `intensity` of `diffuse light`[^1] is directional and is a `function`[^2] of the angle of the incoming `light` and the surface. This type of shading is called `Lambertian shading` after `Lambert's cosine law`, which states that the `intensity` of the `light` reflected from an ideal `diffuse`[^1] surface is proportional to the `cosine` of the direction of the `light` to the `vertex normal`.[^3]  
There are `per-vertex` `normals`[^3] in with each `vertex` has a `normal`[^3] associated with it and then there are `per-polygon` `normals`[^3] which have _one_ `normal`[^3] shared across all `vertices` of the `polygone`.

> [!NOTE] `OpenGL` can specify `per-polygon` `normals`[^3] but `Direct3D` cannot.

$$i_d = (\hat n \cdot \hat l) i_a$$

$$i_d = (\hat n \cdot \hat l) (m_d \otimes s_d)$$

here $\hat l$ is the direction _to_ the `light source`.

Practically speaking, we don't want `vertices` where `light` cannot shine on

///  

$$i_d = \max(0, (\hat n \cdot \hat l) (m_d \otimes s_d))$$

Problem with `diffuse light`[^1] alone is that, it is independent of the viewing angle. 

### Specular light

While `ambient light`[^1] gives the object an illuminated `matte surface`, specular `light` is what gives the `highlights` to an object. These `highlights` are greatest when the viewer is looking directly along the `reflection` angle from the `surface`.

## Phong's Specular light Equation

`Warnock [WARNOCK 1969]` and `Romney [ROMNEY 1969]` were the first to try to simulate `highlights` using a $\cos (n \theta)$ term. `Phong Bui-Tong [BUI 1998]` reformulated this into a more general model that formalized the power value as a measure of surface `roughness` that we approach the terms used today for `specular highlights`.

The $(\hat r \cdot \hat v)^{m_s}$ for $m \in [0, 1]$ doesn't get any brighter.

$$\vec r = \frac{2(\vec n \cdot \vec l) \vec n}{|n|^2} - \vec l$$

> [!NOTE]- Proof
> 
> - $\vec r \cdot \vec n = \vec l \cdot \vec n$
> - $2(\vec r \cdot \vec n) = 2(\vec l \cdot \vec n)$
> - $2(\vec r \cdot \vec n) \cdot \vec n = 2(\vec l \cdot \vec n) \cdot \vec n$
> - $(\vec r \cdot \vec n) \cdot \vec n + (\vec r \cdot \vec n) \cdot \vec n = 2(\vec l \cdot \vec n) \cdot \vec n$
> - $\vec r \cdot \vec n \cdot \vec n + \vec l \cdot \vec n \cdot \vec n = 2(\vec l \cdot \vec n) \cdot \vec n \quad \because (\vec r \cdot \vec n) = (\vec l \cdot \vec n)$
> - $\vec r |n|^2 + \vec l |n|^2 = 2(\vec l \cdot \vec n) \cdot \vec n$
> - $|n|^2(\vec r + \vec l) = 2(\vec l \cdot \vec n) \cdot \vec n$
> - $(\vec r + \vec l) = \frac{2(\vec l \cdot \vec n) \cdot \vec n}{|n|^2}$
> - $\vec r = \frac{2(\vec l \cdot \vec n) \cdot \vec n}{|n|^2} - \vec l$

The equation simplifies if $\vec n$ and $\vec l$ are normalized

$$\implies \hat r = 2(\hat n \cdot \hat l) \hat n - \hat l$$

## Blinn's Simplification: `OpenGL` and `DirectX` Lighting

$$i_s = (m_s \otimes s_s)(\hat n \cdot \hat h)^{m_s}$$

where $\vec h$ is the `half angle vector`[^4] and is defined as

$$\vec h = \frac{\vec l + \vec v}{|\vec l + \vec v|}$$
