## Single User Systems

These systems are designed to provide most convenience to a single user instead of focusing over maximizing utility of the CPU and other peripheral devices.

## Batch Systems

Early computers were controlled by consoles with card readers. These computers would output data on punch cards and also take in punch cards as inputs, which describe the "job" which needs to be performed. These inputs were handed over to computer operators who would feed it to the computer but due to slow mechanical I/O movements, a lot of CPU time was wasted.
In these systems, users would not be able to interact with their jobs and jobs with similar needs were executed in a "batch"
