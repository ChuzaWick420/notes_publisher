## Memory Protection

### Process Address Space

The area of memory which a `process` is allowed to access is called `process address space`.  
A `process` must not be able to access memory outside of this space otherwise it can corrupt memory of other `processes` and even `operating system`.[^1]

There are 2 `registers` used to provide `memory protection`.

#### Base Register

It holds the smallest legal `physical memory address` for a `process`.

#### Limit Register

It contains the size of the `process`.

## `CPU` Protection

We use a `timer` which interrupts the `CPU` to make sure that the user doesn't get stuck in an infinite loop and control remains in `operating system`[^1]'s hands.  
The `timer` period can be fixed or variable.  
A variable `timer` can be made by using a `fixed rate clock` and a `counter`.  
The `operating system`[^1] sets the `counter` to some positive number $N$ called the `time slice` which decrements over time with each `clock` impulse, using the `clock interrupt service routine`.  
After the `counter` reaches $0$, a `timer interrupt` is generated, `operating system`[^1] is invoked and control is transferred back to the `CPU` while it performs house keeping tasks.

> [!NOTE] `Load-Timer` is a `privileged instruction`.

## `OS`[^1] Components

### Process Management

A `process` can be though of a `program` in execution.

It needs certain resources to perform its task such as

- CPU time
- Memory
- Files 
- I/O devices

The `operating system`[^1] is responsible for

- Creating and terminating both `user` and `system processes`
- Suspending and resuming `processes`
- Providing mechanisms for
	- process synchronization  
	- process communication  
	- deadlock handling

### Main Memory Management

`Main memory` is an array (a repository) of `bytes`, each with their own `address` which hold quickly accessible data by `CPU` and `I/O` devices.  
It contains the `code`, `data`, `stack` and other parts of a `process`.  
The `CPU` reads instruction during its machine cycle

- Fetch
- Decode
- Execute

The `operating system`[^1] is responsible for following activities in connection with memory management.

- Keeping track of free `memory space`
- Keeping track of which parts of `memory` are currently being used and by whom  
- Deciding which `processes` are to be loaded into `memory` when `memory space` becomes available  
- Deciding how much `memory` is to be allocated to a `process`  
- Allocating and deallocating `memory space` as needed  
- Ensuring that a `process` is not overwritten on top of another

### Secondary Storage Management

The programs alongside with the data they process, have to be loaded into the `main memory` or `primary storage`.  
The computer system must provide a `secondary storage` for source and destination of programs and their data as the `main memory` is temporary.

The `operating system`[^1] does the following in this context

- Free space management
- Storage allocation and deallocation
- Disk scheduling

### I/O System Management

The `I/O` system consists of

- A `memory management` component that includes 
	- `buffering`
	- `caching`
	- `spooling`
- A general `device driver` interface
- `Drivers` for `specific hardware devices`

### File Management

Computers can store information on several types of physical media, such as

- Magnetic tape
- Magnetic disk
- Optical disk

The `operating system`[^1] maps these files onto the `physical media` and accesses these media via the `storage devices`.

The `OS`[^1] is responsible for the following activities with respect to `file management`  

- Creating and deleting files  
- Creating and deleting directories  
- Supporting primitives (operations) for manipulating files and directories  
- Mapping files onto the secondary storage  
- Backing up files on stable (nonvolatile) storage media

### Protection System

There can be multiple `users` and `processes` running at the same time and the resources must be protected from each other's activities to prevent loss.

### Networking

A `distributed system` is a collection of `processors` that do not share `memory`, `peripheral devices` or a `clock`.  
Instead each `processor` has its own local `memory` and `clock` and the `processors` communicate with each other through various communication lines such as high speed buses or networks.

A `distributed system` collects physically separate and possibly heterogeneous systems, into a single coherent system providing the user with access to the various resources that system maintains.

### Command line Interpreter (shells)

It is an interface between the `users` and the `operating system`.[^1]  
Some `operating systems`[^1] provide the `interpreter` in the `kernel`.  
Other operating systems like `Linux`, `Unix` and `DOS` treat it like a special program.  
It is also known as `shell` sometimes.  
There are some examples

- Bourne shell (`sh`)
- C shell (`csh`)
- Bourne Again shell (`bash`)
- TC shell (`tcsh`)
- Korn shell (`ksh`)

## Operating System Services

### Program Execution

The system must be able to do the following in regards to `programs`

- Load
- Execute
- Terminate

### `I/O Operations`

A running `program` may require a `file` or an `I/O` device.  
For efficiency and protective reasons, `users` usually cannot directly access the `I/O` devices and need the middle man, that is `operating system`.[^1]

### File System Manipulation

`Programs` should be able to do the following operations on `files`.

- Create
- Modify
- Delete

### Communications

There can be communication between `processes` through `shared memory` or `message passing`.

### Error Detection

Errors can occur in any part of the system and `operating system`[^1] should be able to know where the error has occurred and how to respond to them.

---

In order to assist the efficient operation of the system itself, the system provides the following functions

### Resource Allocation

When multiple `users` and `jobs` are running on the system, resources must be allocated to each of them.

### Accounting

We can keep track of which `user` accesses certain resources to later generate statistics.

### Protection

When multiple `users` and `processes` are executing, the resources must be protected from corruption by each other.

## Entry point into Kernel

There are 4 events that cause execution of a piece of code in the `kernel`.  
These events are

- Interrupt
- Trap
- System call
- Signal

### System Calls

These provide an interface between the `process` and the `operating system`.[^1] These calls are generally available as `assembly language instructions`.  
The interface to `system calls` is the entry point of `kernel code` which is not usually and easily provided to the `user` for security reasons.  
These are categorized into following groups

- Process Control  
- File Management  
- Device Management  
- Information maintenance  
- Communications

#### Semantics of System Call Execution

Following sequence of events take place when a `user` invokes a `system call`.

- The `user process` makes a call to a `library function`.
- The `library routine` puts the appropriate `parameters` on a well known place such as `registers` or on the `stack`. These `parameters` include arguments for the `system call`, `return address` and `call number`. There are 3 general methods used to pass parameters between a running `program` and the `operating system`.
	- Pass `parameters` in `registers`
	- Store the `parameters` in a table which is stored on the `main memory` and the table `address` is passed as a `parameter` in a `register`.
	- Push the `parameters` onto the `stack` by the program and pop off the `stack` by `operating system`.[^1]
- A `trap` instruction is executed to change mode from `user` to `kernel` and give control to `operating system`.[^1]
- The `operating system`[^1] then determines which `system call` is to be carried out by examining one of the `parameters` (the call number) passed to it by `library routine`.
- The `kernel` uses call number to index a `kernel table` (the `dispatch table`) which contains pointers to `service routines` for all `system calls`.
- The `service routine` is executed and control given back to `user program` via return from `trap instruction` the instruction also changes mode from `system` to `user`.
- The `library function` executes the instruction following `trap` interprets the return values from the `kernel` and returns to the user `process`.
