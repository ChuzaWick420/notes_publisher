## Inter Process Communication

It provides a mechanism for `processes` to communicate and synchronize their actions without sharing the same `address space`.

## Message Passing System

This allows `processes` to communicate without shared data. `Messages` sent by a `process` may be of either fixed or variable length.

There are several methods for logically implementing a link for the `processes` to communicate.

### Direct Communication

#### Primitives

##### `#!cpp Send(P, message)`

Sends a `message` to `process` `P`.

##### `#!cpp Receive(Q, message)`

Receive a `message` from `process` `Q`.

#### Properties

- Only 1 `link` can exist between exactly 2 `processes`.
- `Processes` need to know each other's `ID` to be able to communicate.

### Indirect Communication

#### Primitives

##### `#!cpp Send(A, message)`

Send a `message` to mailbox `A`.

##### `#!cpp Receive(A, message)`

Receive a `message` from mailbox `A`.

#### Properties

- A `link` between multiple `processes` will only exist if they share the same `mailbox`.
- Multiple `links` can exist but each will be associated with a certain `mailbox`.

### Synchronization

#### Primitives

##### Blocking Send

The sending `process` is blocked until the `message` is received.

##### Non Blocking Send

The sending `process` sends the `message` and resumes operation.

##### Blocking Receive

The `receiver` blocks until a `message` is available.

##### Non Blocking Receiver

The `receiver` receives either a valid `message` or a `null`.

### Buffering

`Messages` exchanged by the `processes` reside in a temporary `queue`.

#### Zero Capacity

- Has zero length.
- `Message` cannot wait.
- `Sender` must block `receiver`.

#### Bounded Capacity

- Has $n$ size.
- `Sender` blocks `receiver` until there is space in `queue`.

#### Unbounded Capacity

- Has $\infty$ size.
- `Sender` never blocks `receiver`.

## Unix / Linux [IPC](#inter-process-communication) Tools

- Pipe
- Named pipe (FIFO)
- BSD Socket
- TLI
- Message queue
- Shared memory

## `#!cpp read()`

```cpp
#include <unistd.h>
ssize_t read(int file_descriptor, void* buf, size_t count);
```

if `count` is

- $= 0$ then `#!cpp read()` returns $0$.
- $>$ `SSIZE_MAX`, the result is unspecified.

On success, `#!cpp read()` returns number of `bytes` read and `0` indicates `EOF`.  
It also advances the `file position pointer`.

## `#!cpp write()`

```cpp
#include <unistd.h>
ssize_t write(int file_descriptor, const void* buf, size_t count);
```

## `#!cpp close()`

```cpp
#include <unistd.h>
int close(int file_descriptor);
```

## `#!cpp pipe()`

```cpp
#include <unistd.h>
int pipe(int file_descriptor[2]);
```

1. For reading
2. For writing

A `pipe` is [bounded buffer](#bounded-capacity) and the maximum data which can be written, is `PIPE_BUF`.  
Defined:

- as $5120$ in `#!cpp "sys/param.h"`
- as $4096$ in `#!cpp "linux/param.h"`

### Example

```c
/* Parent creates pipe, forks a child, child writes into
   pipe, and parent reads from pipe */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>     // For exit()
#include <string.h>     // For strlen()
#include <unistd.h>     // For pipe(), fork(), read(), write(), close()
#include <sys/types.h>  // For pid_t
#include <sys/wait.h>   // For wait()

int main() {
    int pipefd[2], pid, n, rc, nr, status;
    char *testString = "Hello, world!\n";
    char buf[1024];

    rc = pipe(pipefd);
    if (rc < 0) {
        perror("pipe");
        exit(1);
    }

    pid = fork();
    if (pid < 0) {
        perror("fork");
        exit(1);
    }

    if (pid == 0) { /* Child’s Code */
        close(pipefd[0]); // Close read end
        write(pipefd[1], testString, strlen(testString));
        close(pipefd[1]);
        exit(0);
    }

    /* Parent’s Code */
    close(pipefd[1]); // Close write end
    n = strlen(testString);
    nr = read(pipefd[0], buf, n);
    rc = write(1, buf, nr);
    wait(&status);
    printf("Good work child!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
