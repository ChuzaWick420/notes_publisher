# 43. Inner Product Space

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 21-06-2025</span>

## Inner Product Space

The `inner product`[^1] is helpful in introducing rigorous intuitive geometrical notions such as `length`, `angle`, `orthogonality`[^2] between 2 `vectors`.[^3] Now consider a _mathematical structure_ which associates the `inner product`[^1] with a pair of `vectors`[^3] and now imagine this _structure_ contained within a `vector space`[^4] called the `inner product space`.  
This also generalizes the `Euclidean spaces` into `vector spaces`,[^4] possibly of infinite dimensions and are also studied in `functional analysis`.

## Definition

An `inner product`[^1] on a `vector space`[^4] $\mathbb V$ is a `function`[^5] that assigned a `real number` $\langle \vec u, \vec v \rangle$ to a pair of `vectors`[^3] $\vec u$ and $\vec v$ and satisfies following `axioms`

For all $\vec u, \vec v, \vec w \in \mathbb V$ and all `scalars` $c$.

- $$\langle\vec u, \vec v\rangle = \langle\vec u, \vec v\rangle$$

- $$\langle\vec u + \vec v, \vec w \rangle = \langle\vec u, \vec w\rangle + \langle \vec v, \vec w\rangle$$

- $$\langle c\vec u, \vec v\rangle = c\langle\vec u, \vec v\rangle$$

- $$\langle \vec v, \vec v\rangle \ge 0 \text{ and } \langle \vec v, \vec v \rangle = 0 \iff \vec v = 0$$

A `vector space`[^4] with an inner product is called `inner product space`.

## Norm of a `Vector`[^3]

Let $\mathbb V$ be an [inner product space](#inner-product-space) with `inner product`[^3] denoted by $\langle \vec u, \vec v \rangle$ just as in $\mathbb R^n$, we define the `norm` of `length` of a `vector`[^3] to be the `scalar`  

$$||\vec v|| = \sqrt{\langle\vec u, \vec v\rangle}$$

- A `unit vector`[^3] whose length is $1$.
- The distance between $\vec u$ and $\vec v$ is $||\vec u - \vec v||$ and they are `orthogonal`[^2] if $\langle \vec u, \vec v\rangle = 0$.

## Best Approximation in Inner Produce Spaces

Imagine a `vector space`[^4] $\mathbb{V}$ whose elements are `functions`.[^5] The task is to approximate a `function`[^5] $f \in \mathbb{V}$ by another `function`[^5] $g \in \mathbb{W} \subset \mathbb{V}$. How we measure the quality of this approximation depends on how we define the "distance" between $f$ and $g$, which in this case is derived from an `inner product`.[^1] Under this setup, the best approximation of $f$ by elements of $\mathbb{W}$ is given by the `orthogonal projection`[^2] of $f$ onto $\mathbb{W}$.

## Cauchy – Schwarz Inequality

$$|\langle \vec u, \vec v \rangle| \le ||\vec u|| \ ||\vec v|| \quad \forall \vec u, \vec v \in \mathbb V$$

## Triangle Inequality

$$|\langle \vec u, \vec v \rangle| \le ||\vec u|| + ||\vec v|| \quad \forall \vec u, \vec v \in \mathbb V$$

## Inner Product for $C[a, b]$

$C[a, b]$ is a `vector space`[^4] of `continuous functions`[^6] over the `interval`[^7] $a \le t \le b$.  
For $f$ and $g$ in $C[a, b]$  

$$\langle f, g \rangle = \int_b^a f(t) g(t) dt$$
