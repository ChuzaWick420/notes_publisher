# 08. Linear Independence

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 12-03-2025</span>

## Definition

An indexed `set`[^1] of `vectors`[^2] in $\mathbb R^n$ is said to be `linearly independent` if $x_1 \vec v_1 + x_2 \vec v_2 + \cdots + x_p \vec v_p = 0$ has only `trivial solution`.[^3]

## Linear Independence of Matrix Column

The columns of a `matrix` $A$ are [linearly independent](#definition) if and only if the equation $A \vec x = \vec 0$ has only the `trivial solution`.[^3]

## Set of One Vector

The `set`[^1] $\{\vec v\}$ is [linearly independent](#definition) if $\vec v$ is not a `null vector`.[^2] $x_1 \vec v = \vec 0$ only `trivial solution`[^3] when $\vec v \ne \vec 0$.  
The equation $x_1 \vec 0 = \vec 0$ has many non trivial solutions that is why $\vec v \ne \vec 0$.

## Theorem

An indexed set $S = \{\vec {v_1}, \vec{v_2}, \ldots, \vec{v_n}\}$ is [linearly dependent](#definition) if at least one `vector`[^2] $\vec {v_i} \in S$ is a `linear combination`[^4] of the others.

> [!NOTE] There will be `vectors`[^2] in $S$ which are NOT `linear combinations`[^4] of the others, despite $S$ being [linearly dependent](#definition).

## Theorem

A `set`[^1] $S = \{\vec {v_1}, \vec {v_2}, \ldots, \vec {v_p}\} \in \mathbb R^n$ is [linearly dependent](#definition) if $p > n$.

## Theorem

A `set`[^1] $S = \{\vec {v_1}, \vec {v_2}, \ldots, \vec {v_p}\} \in \mathbb R^n$ is [linearly dependent](#definition) if $\vec 0 \in S$.
