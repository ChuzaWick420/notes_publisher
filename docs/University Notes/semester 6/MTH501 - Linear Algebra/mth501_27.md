# 27. Applications to Difference Equations

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 11-06-2025</span>

## Discrete time Signals

Let $S$ be a `space` of `discrete time signals` and $s \in S$ be a `function`[^1] defined over `integers` and is visualized by a `sequence`[^2] $\{y_k\}$.

### Example

The crystal clear sounds from a compact disc player are produced from music that has been sampled at the rate of $41,000$ times per second. At each measurement, the amplitude of the music signal is recorded as a number, say, $y_k$. The original music is composed of many different sounds of varying frequencies, yet the `sequence`[^2] $\{y_k\}$ contains enough information to reproduce all the frequencies in the sound up to about $20,000$ cycles per second, higher than the human ear can sense.

## Linear Independence in the `space` $S$ of Signals

Consider 3 signals $\{\vec u_k\}, \{\vec v_k\}$ and $\{\vec w_k\}$ and they are `linearly independent` when  

$$c_1 \vec u_k + c_2 \vec v_k + c_3 \vec w_k = 0 \quad \forall k$$

For the next 2 consecutive samples,  

$$c_1 \vec u_{k + 1} + c_2 \vec v_{k + 1} + c_3 \vec w_{k + 1} = 0 \quad \forall k$$

$$c_1 \vec u_{k + 2} + c_2 \vec v_{k + 2} + c_3 \vec w_{k + 2} = 0 \quad \forall k$$

$$
\implies
\begin{bmatrix}
	\vec u_k & \vec v_k & \vec w_k \\
	\vec u_{k + 1} & \vec v_{k + 1} & \vec w_{k + 1} \\
	\vec u_{k + 2} & \vec v_{k + 2} & \vec w_{k + 2}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
	c_1 \\
	c_2 \\
	c_3
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
	0 \\
	0 \\
	0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The `coefficient matrix`[^3] in this system is called thee `Casorati matrix` of the signals and its determinant is called the `Casoratian`.

## Linear Difference Equations

Given scalars $a_0, \ldots, a_n \neq 0$ and a signal $\{z_k\}$, the following equation is called `linear difference equation` or `linear recurrence relation` of order $n$.  

$$a_0 \cdot \vec y_{k + n} + a_1 \cdot \vec y_{k + n - 1} + \ldots + a_{n - 1} \cdot \vec y_{k + 1} + a_n \cdot \vec y_k = \vec z_k$$

In simple words, an equation which expresses a value of a `sequence`[^2] as a function of the other terms in the `sequence`[^2] is called a `difference equation`.

## Example

In `digital signal processing`, an equation like above describes a `linear filter` and the coefficients $a_0, \ldots, a_n$ are called the `filter coefficients`.  
If $\{y_k\}$ is treated as the input and $\{z_k\}$ the output, then the solutions of the associated `homogeneous equation` are the signals that are filtered out and transformed into the zero signal. 

Assume a `filter`

$$0.35 \vec y_{k + 2} + 0.5 \vec y_{k+1} + 0.35 \vec y_k = \vec z_k$$

### Signal 1

$$\vec y = \cos\left(\frac {\pi t} 4\right)$$

If we sample this for `integer` values of $t$, we get

$$\{\vec y_k\} = \left\{\cos(0), \cos\left(\frac \pi 4\right), \cos\left(\frac {2 \pi} 4\right), \ldots\right\}$$

$$= \{1, 0.7, 0, -0.7, \ldots\}$$

|   $k$    | $\vec y_k$ | $\vec y_{k + 1}$ | $\vec y_{k + 2}$ | $0.35 \vec y_{k + 2} + 0.5 \vec y_{k+1} + 0.35 \vec y_k = \vec z_k$ |
| :------: | :--------: | :--------------: | :--------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------: |
|   $0$    |    $1$     |      $0.7$       |       $0$        |                                $0.7$                                |
|   $1$    |   $0.7$    |       $0$        |      $-0.7$      |                                 $0$                                 |
|   $2$    |    $0$     |      $-0.7$      |       $-1$       |                               $-0.7$                                |
| $\vdots$ |  $\vdots$  |     $\vdots$     |     $\vdots$     |                              $\vdots$                               |

### Signal 2

$$\vec y = \cos\left(\frac{3 \pi t} 4\right)$$

$$\{\vec w_k\} = \{1, -0.7, 0, 0.7, \ldots\}$$

After this signal is passed through the filter, the output it `zero sequence`.  
This filter is called the `low pass filter` as it allows a signal of lower frequency $\{\vec y_k\}$ but blocks $\{\vec w_k\}$.

## Example

$$y_{k + 3} - 2y_{k + 2} - 5y_{k + 1} + 6 y_k = 0 \quad \forall k$$

Substitute $r^k = y_k$

$$r^{k+3} - 2r^{k+2} - 5r^{k+1} + 6r^k = 0$$

$$r^k (r^3 - 2r^2 - 5r + 6) = 0$$

Using `synthetic division`

$$
\begin{array}{c|ccc|c}
	  & 1 & -2 & -5 & 6 \\
	1 & 0 & 1 & -1 & -6 \\
	\hline
	  & 1 & -1 & -6 & 0
\end{array}
$$

$$r^k ((x-1)(x^2 - x - 6)) = 0$$

 $$r^k ((x-1)(x^2 - 3x + 2x - 6)) = 0$$

 $$r^k ((x-1) (x(x-3)+2(x-3))) = 0$$

 $$r^k (r-1)(r+2)(r-3) = 0$$

$$r - 1 = 0 \implies r = 1$$

$$r + 2 = 0 \implies r = -2$$

$$r - 3 = 0 \implies r = 3$$

$$r^k = 0 \implies 1^k, (-2)^k, 3^k \text{ are the solutions}$$

If $r$ is a root of `auxiliary equation`  

$$r^n + a_1 \cdot r^{n-1} + \ldots + a_{n-1} \cdot r + a_n \cdot 1 = 0$$

then a non zero signal $r^k$ satisfies the homogeneous difference equation  

$$y_{k+n} + a_1 y_{k+n-1} + \dots + a_{n-1} y_{k+1} + a_n y_k = 0 \quad \forall k$$

## Solution Sets of Linear Difference Equations

Given $a_1, \ldots, a_n$, consider mapping $T: \mathbb S \to \mathbb S$ that transforms a signal $\{y_k\}$ to $\{w_k\}$ given by  

$$w_k = y_{k+n} + a_1 y_{k+n-1} + \ldots + a_{n-1} y_{k+1} + a_n y_k$$

Since $T$ is a `linear transformation`,[^4] this implies that the solution to homogeneous equation 

$$y_{k+n} + a_1 y_{k+n-1} + \dots + a_{n-1} y_{k+1} + a_n y_k = 0$$

is the `kernel`[^5] of $T$ (since it is `set`[^6] of signals which map to zero signal) and hence, is a solution of `subspace`[^7] of $S$.

## Theorem

If $a_n \neq 0$ and if $\{z_k\}$ is given by  

$$y_{k+n} + a_1 y_{k+n-1} + \dots + a_{n-1} y_{k+1} + a_n y_k = 0 \quad \forall k$$

has a unique solution whenever $y_0, \ldots, y_{n - 1}$ are specified.

## Theorem

The `set`[^6] $\mathbb H$ of all solutions of the $n^{th}$ order `homogeneous linear difference equation`  

$$y_{k+n} + a_1 y_{k+n-1} + \dots + a_{n-1} y_{k+1} + a_n y_k = 0 \quad \forall k$$

is an $n$ dimensional `vector space`.[^7]

## Non-homogeneous Equations

The solution for the following  

$$y_{k+n} + a_1 y_{k+n-1} + \dots + a_{n-1} y_{k+1} + a_n y_k = 0 \quad \forall k$$

has the form  

$$s = p + h$$

where $s$ is the solution, $p$ is the `particular solution` and $h$ is the `linear combination`[^4] of a fundamental `set`[^6] of solutions for the corresponding `homogeneous equation`.

## Reduction to Systems of First-order Equations

A modern way to study a `homogeneous` $n^{th}$ order [linear difference equation](#linear-difference-equations) is to replace it by an equivalent system of first order [difference equations](#linear-difference-equations), written in the form $\vec x_{k+1} = A_{n \times n} \vec x_k$ where $\vec x \in \mathbb R^n$.

### Example

Write the following [difference equation](#linear-difference-equations) as a first order system

$$y_{k+3} - 2y_{k+2} - 5y_{k+1} + 6y_k = 0 \quad \forall k$$

#### Solution

For each $k$,  

$$x_k = \begin{bmatrix} y_k \\ y_{k+1} \\ y_{k+2} \end{bmatrix}$$

$$\because y_{k+3} - 2y_{k+2} - 5y_{k+1} + 6y_k = 0$$

$$\implies y_{k+3} = 2y_{k+2} + 5y_{k+1} - 6y_k$$

$$
x_{k+1} = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
	y_{k+1} \\
	y_{k+2} \\
	y_{k+3}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
	0 + y_{k+1} + 0 \\
	0 + 0 + y_{k+2} \\
	-6y_k + 5y_{k+1} + 2y_{k+2}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
	0 & 1 & 0 \\
	0 & 0 & 1 \\
	-6 & 5 & 2
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
	y_k \\
	y_{k+1} \\
	y_{k+2}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$\vec x_{k + 1} = A \vec x_k \quad \forall k$$

Where  

$$A=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ -6 & 5 & 2 \end{bmatrix}$$

In general

$$
x_k 
=
\begin{bmatrix}
	y_k \\
	y_{k+1} \\
	\vdots \\
	y_{k+n-1}
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
	0 & 1 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
	0 & 0 & 1 & \dots & 0 \\
	\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
	0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 1 \\
	-a_n & -a_{n-1} & -a_{n-2} & \dots & -a_1
\end{bmatrix}$$
