## Two Pass Compiler

Structure of a 2 pass `compiler`.

Immediate advantage is that it admits multiple frontends and multiple passes.  
The algorithms employed in the `frontend` have `polynomial` `time complexity`[^1]

## Cross Compilation

Imagine three machines

- Windows IA-32 (32 bit version of `x86_64` architecture)
- Mac OS `x86_64`
- Android `ARM`

Now imagine the `source code` on windows machine. We use `MSVC` to compile the code for the windows platform. Then we use `gcc` to compile this into `x86_64` platform.  
Now this `x86_64` version can be recompiled into `ARM` code on the Mac machine.

## Front End

Front end

The `front end` rejects the illegal code and reports the `error` in a useful way. For the legal code, it produces `IR` and storage allocation maps for various data structures declared in the program.  
The `front end` is made up for following parts

### Scanner

The `word` is the basic unit of syntax.  
A `token` is a pair of `word` and its `part of speech`(`<token type, word>`).  
Typical `tokens` are:

- Numbers
- Identifiers
- `#!cpp new`  
- `#!cpp while`
- `#!cpp if`
- `+`
- `-`  
etc

The `scanner` takes the input program and breaks it down to `tokens`.

#### Example

```
x = x + y
```

is converted to

```
<id, x>
<assign, =>
<id, x>
<op, +>
<id, y>
```

### Parser

The `parser` takes in the stream of [tokens](#scanner), recognizes `context free syntax` and reports errors. It guides the context-sensitive (`semantic`) analysis for tasks like `type checking` and outputs `intermediate representation`.

The syntax of most programming languages is specified using `Context Free Grammars`(CFG).  
`Context Free` syntax is specified with grammar $G=(S, N, T, P)$.

- $S$ is for starting symbol.
- $N$ is a `set`[^2] of `non terminal` symbols.
- $T$ is a `set`[^2] of `terminal` symbols.
- $P$ is a `set`[^2] of `productions` or rewrite rules.

### Example

`Context Free Grammar` for arithmetic expressions is

```
goal ? expr
expr ? expr op term
     | term
term ? number
	 | id
op   ? +
     | -
```

$$S = \text{goal}$$

$$T = \{\text{number}, \text{id}, +, -\}$$

$$N= \{\text{goal}, \text{expr}, \text{term}, \text{op}\}$$

$$P = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0\}$$

Consider the sentence  

$$x + 2 - y$$

| _Production_           | _Result_         |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- |
|                        | goal             |
| 1: goal → expr         | expr             |
| 2: expr → expr op term | expr op term     |
| 5: term → **id**       | expr op y        |
| 7: op → `-`            | expr - y         |
| 2: expr → expr op term | expr op term - y |
| 4: term → **number**   | expr op 2 - y    |
| 6: op → `+`            | expr + 2 - y     |
| 3: expr → term         | term + 2 - y     |
| 5: term → **id**       | x + 2 - y        |

To recognize a valid sentence in some CFG, we _reverse_ this process and buildup a `parse`.
