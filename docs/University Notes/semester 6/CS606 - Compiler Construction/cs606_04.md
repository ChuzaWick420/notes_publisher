# Lecture No. 04

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 13-03-2025</span>

The CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) provided a rich instruction set and addressing modes but this made the compiler's job of outputting efficient machine code harder.  
The RISC architecture simplified this problem.

## Register Allocation

`Registers` provide a very important role for providing high speed access to the `operands` for computation because memory accessing these `operands` is a lot more slower. The `back end`[^1] tries to keep these `operands` in the `registers` for use but it has to manage the limitations of resources such as number of `registers` which are already in use and are not available to it (such as the `program counter`) or the `registers` themselves are very small etc.  
Optimal register allocation is `NP-Complete`.

## Instruction Scheduling

Modern processors have multiple functional units. The `back end`[^1] needs to schedule instructions to avoid hardware stalls and interlocks. The generated code should use all functional units productively. Optimal scheduling is `NP-Complete` in nearly all cases.

## Three Pass Compiler

The `middle end` is also called the `optimizer` and as the name suggests, its task is to optimize the `intermediate representation` by reducing the resource consumption.

- Space
- Time
- Power

Typical transformations performed by the `optimizer` are

- Discover & propagate some constant value
- Move a computation to a less frequently executed place
- Specialize some computation based on context
- Discover a redundant computation & remove it
- Remove useless or unreachable code
- Encode an idiom in some particularly efficient form

## Role of Runtime System

The program code runs as a `process` in the `operating system`. The compiler needs the knowledge of the runtime system to make effective use of the runtime environment and machine resources.  
The problems which need to be addressed in this context are

- Memory management
- Allocate and de-allocate memory
- Garbage collection
- Run-time type checking
- Error/ exception processing
- Interface to OS - I/O
- Support for parallelism
- Parallel threads
- Communication and synchronization
