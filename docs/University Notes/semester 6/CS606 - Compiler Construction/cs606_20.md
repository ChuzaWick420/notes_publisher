## Bottom up Parsing

It is more general and preferred method in practice and is also called `LR parsing`.

- `L` means `tokens`[^1] are read from _left to right_.
- `R` means the `parser`[^2] constructs a `right most derivation`.

These `parsers`[^2] don't need `left factored grammar` and can handle `left recursion grammars`.[^3]

A `derivation` consists of a `series` of rewrite steps  

$$S \implies \gamma_0 \implies \gamma_1 \implies \ldots \implies \gamma_{n - 1} \implies \gamma_n \implies \text{sentence}$$

- If $\gamma$ contains $\ge 1$ `non terminals`[^4] then it is called `sentential form`.
- If $\gamma$ contains only `terminals`[^4] then it is called a `sentence`.

These `parsers`[^2] work by starting from the `sentence` and working up to the `start symbol`.

### Grammar

$$S \to aABe$$

$$A \to Abc | b$$

$$B \to d$$

### Sentence

$$abbcde$$

### Derivation

#### Right Most

$$S \to aABe$$

$$\to aAde$$

$$\to aAbcde$$

$$\to abbcde$$

### Example

#### Grammar

```
E -> E + (E)
  |  int
```

#### Sentence

$$\text{int } + \text{(int) } + \text{(int)}$$

#### Derivation (right most)

$$E$$

$$E + (E)$$

$$E + (\text{int})$$

$$E + (E) + (\text{int})$$

$$E + (\text{int}) + (\text{int})$$

$$\text{int} + (\text{int}) + (\text{int})$$

Reduction would take place from the left side.
