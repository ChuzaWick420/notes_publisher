## Table Encoding of Finite Automaton

A `finite automaton`[^1] can be encoded as a `table`. This is called `transition table`.

|     | a   | b   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 1   | err |
| 1   | 2   | 1   |
| 2   | err | err |

![[cs606_e_7_1.svg]]

```cpp
int finite_automaton () {

    int trans_table[NSTATES][NCHARS];
    int accept_states[NSTATES];

    int state = INITIAL;

    while (state != err) {
        c = input.read();
        if (c == EOF)
            break;

        state = trans_table[state][c];
    }

    return accept_states[state];
}
```

## Non Deterministic Finite Automaton

Each `regular expression`[^2] can be used to encode a `token`[^3] and is converted to a `non deterministic finite automaton`[^4] which are joined using $\epsilon$ moves into a single `deterministic finite automaton`[^1] which can later be encoded in a `transition table`.  
A `non deterministic finite automaton`[^4] can have multiple transitions for one input in a given table.  
![[cs606_e_7_2.svg]]  

Sometimes it might not even need an input character for transition.  
![[cs606_e_7_3.svg]]

The acceptance of `non deterministic finite automaton`[^4] for a given `string`[^4] is determined if it can reach a final `state` or not.

## Deterministic Finite Automaton

This one has only one transition per input per state without $\epsilon$ moves.  
Both `NFAs`[^4] and `DFAs`[^1] can recognize same `set`[^4] of `languages`[^5] though `DFAs` are easier but can be exponentially larger than `NFAs`. Therefore, `NFAs` are the key for automating `RE -> DFA` construction.

## `RE`[^2] → `NFA`[^4] Construction

The algorithm for `regular expression`[^2] to `DFA` conversion is called `Thompson's Construction`. The algorithm appeared in `CACM 1968`. It works as follows

- Builds a `NFA`[^4] for each `regular expression`.[^2]
- The `NFAs`[^4] are combined using $\epsilon$ moves.
- The `NFA`[^4] is converted into `DFA`.[^1]
- The number of `states` is reduced in the `DFA`[^1] using the `Hopcroft’s algorithm`.

### Example

Consider a `NFA`[^4] for the `regular expression`[^2] $ab$.

`NFA`[^4] for $a$

/// caption  
`NFA`[^4] for $b$  
///

![[cs606_e_7_6.svg]]  
/// caption  
`NFA`[^4] for $ab$. The `NFA`[^4] for $a$ appears first due to its precedence.
