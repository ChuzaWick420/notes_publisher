<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 21-04-2025</span>

## Expression Grammar

$$x - 2 \times y$$

## Tokenized

$$\text{id} - \text{num} \times \text{id}$$

| Step | word | Stack                  | Handle                     | Action   |
| ---- | ---- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- | -------- |
| 1    | id   | ►                      | - none -                   | _shift_  |
| 2    | –    | id ►                   | `<Factor → id,1>`          | _reduce_ |
| 3    | –    | Factor ►               | `<Term → Factor,1>`        | _reduce_ |
| 4    | –    | Term ►                 | `<Expr → Term,1>`          | _reduce_ |
| 5    | –    | Expr ►                 | - none -                   | _shift_  |
| 6    | num  | Expr – ►               | - none -                   | _shift_  |
| 7    | ×    | Expr – num ►           | `<Factor → num,3>`         | _reduce_ |
| 8    | ×    | Expr – Factor ►        | `<Term → Factor,3>`        | _reduce_ |
| 9    | ×    | Expr – Term ►          | - none -                   | _shift_  |
| 10   | id   | Expr – Term × ►        | - none -                   | _shift_  |
| 11   | $    | Expr – Term × id ►     | `<Factor → id,5>`          | *reduce* |
| 12   | $    | Expr – Term × Factor ► | `<Term → Term × Factor,5>` | _reduce_ |
| 13   | $    | Expr – Term ►          | `<Expr → Expr – Term,3>`   | *reduce* |
| 14   | $    | Expr ►                 | `<Goal → Expr,1>`          | _reduce_ |
| 15   |      | Goal                   | - none -                   | _accept_ |

## Handles

The `handle finding` mechanism is crucial in `bottom-up parsing`,[^1] where the `parser`[^2] tracks potential `handles`- `substrings` matching the right-hand side of `productions` to guide `reductions`.  
`Parsing`[^1] starts with `<Goal → Expr,1>` as a potential `handle`,[^3] and as it proceeds, new `handles`[^3] emerge, representing suffixes that can be reduced.

| Count | Handle                 |
| ----- | ---------------------- |
| 1     | <Factor → id>          |
| 2     | <Term → Factor>        |
| 3     | <Expr → Term>          |
| 4     | <Factor → num>         |
| 5     | <Term → Factor>        |
| 6     | <Factor → id>          |
| 7     | <Term → Term x Factor> |
| 8     | <Expr → Expr x Term>   |
| 9     | <Goal → Expr>          |

The notation reveals identical handles and allows tracking future handle discovery.  
For example, in step 6, the parser state `Expr → Expr – • Term` shows it has recognized `Expr –` and is waiting for `Term`.  
Once `Term` is shifted, the handle completes. Each production with _k_ symbols has _k + 1_ potential handle positions, marked by placeholders between or around symbols.

(The `•` symbol presents top of the `stack`)  

- Expr → • Expr – Term  
- Expr → Expr • – Term  
- Expr → Expr – • Term  
- Expr → Expr – Term •
