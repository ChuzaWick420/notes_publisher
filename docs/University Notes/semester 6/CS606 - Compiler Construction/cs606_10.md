# Lecture No. 10

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 17-03-2025</span>

## Syntactic Analysis

The `parser`[^1] ensures that sentences of a programming language that make up a program abide by the syntax of the language. If there are errors, the parser will detect them and reports them accordingly. Consider the following code segment that contains a number of syntax errors:

```cpp
int* foo(int i, int j)) {
	for ( k = 0; i j; )
		fi( i > j )
	return j;
}
```

It is clear that a scanner based upon `regular expressions`[^2] will not be able to detect syntax error.
