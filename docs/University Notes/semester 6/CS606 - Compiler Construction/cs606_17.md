Note that productions output are tracing out a `leftmost derivation`.  
The `grammar symbols` on the `stack` make up `left-sentential forms`.

## $LL(1)$ Table Construction

Consider the start  

$$S ? *\beta A \gamma$$

with $b$ being the next `token`,[^1] we are trying to match $\beta b \gamma$.  
There are 2 possibilities.

- $b$ belongs to an expansion of `A`.
	- We can use any $A ? \alpha$ if $b \in FIRST(\alpha)$, meaning $b$ can derive a `string`[^2] from $\alpha$.
- $b$ does not belong to an expansion of `A`.
	- $A \to \epsilon$ then $S \to *\beta A b \omega$ which means $b \in FOLLOW(A)$.

Any $A \to \alpha$ can be used if $\alpha$ expands to $\epsilon$. We say that $\epsilon \in FIRST(A)$ in this case.

### Definition

$$FIRST(X) = \{b | X \to * ba\} \cup \{\epsilon | X \to * \epsilon\}$$
