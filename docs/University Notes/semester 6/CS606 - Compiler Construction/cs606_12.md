# Lecture No. 12

## Parse Trees

The `derivations` can be represented in a tree-like fashion.  
The interior `nodes` contain the non-terminals used during the `derivation`.  

![[cs606_e_12_1.svg]]  
/// caption  
Left most `deviation`. Evaluation order $x - (2 * y)$.  
///

![[cs606_e_12_2.svg]]  
/// caption  
Right most `deviation`. Evaluation order $(x - 2) * y$.  
///

## Precedence

To add `precedence`, create a `non-terminal` for each level of `precedence`.  
Isolate corresponding part of `grammar` to force parser to recognize high `precedence s`ub-expressions first.  
Here is the revised grammar:

```
1 Goal   ? expr
2 expr   ? expr + term   \
3        | expr - term    |- Level One
4        | term          /
5 term   ? term . factor \
6        | term / factor  |- Level Two
7        | factor        /
8 factor ? number
9        | id
```

| Rule | _Sentential Form_                      |
|------|---------------------------------------|
| -    | _Goal_                                |
| 1    | _Expr_                                |
| 3    | expr – term                           |
| 5    | expr – term. _factor_                 |
| 9    | expr – term. `<id,y>`                 |
| 7    | expr – factor. `<id,y>`               |
| 8    | expr – `<num,2>`. `<id,y>`            |
| 4    | term – `<num,2>`. `<id,y>`            |
| 7    | factor – `<num,2>`. `<id,y>`          |
| 9    | `<id,x>` – `<num,2>`. `<id,y>`        |

![[cs606_e_12_3.svg]]  
/// caption  
Evaluation order $x - (2 * y)$.  
///  

Both `leftmost` and `rightmost derivations` give the same expression because the `grammar` directly encodes the desired `precedence`.

## Ambiguous Grammars

If a `grammar` has more than one `leftmost derivation` for a single `sentential form`, the `grammar` is `ambiguous`.  
The `leftmost` and `rightmost derivations` for a `sentential form` may differ, even in an `unambiguous grammar`.

The following `sentential form` has two `deviations`.  
if $E_1$ then if $E_2$ then $S$ else $S_2$.

```lua
if E1 then
	if E2 then S1
else S2
```

```lua
if E1 then
	if E2 then S1
	else S2
```

The convention in most `programming languages` is to match the `#!cpp else` with the most recent `#!cpp if`.

## Context Free Grammars

The rules in `context free grammar` are called _context free_ because the `non-terminals` occur by themselves to the left of the arrow.

### Example

$$A ? a$$

This rules says that where ever there is an $A$, it can be replaced by $a$.  

### Context Sensitive Grammar Rule

On the other hand  

$$\beta A \gamma ? \beta a \gamma$$

This rules defines a _context_ as pair of `strings`[^1] $\beta A \gamma$.  
Such a rule in which $a \to \epsilon$ is called `context sensitive grammar rule`.

## Parsing Techniques

### Top down

A `top-down parsers` starts at the `root` of the parse tree and grows towards `leaves`.  
At each `node`, the `parser` picks a production and tries to match the input.  
However, the `parser` may pick the wrong `production` in which case it will need to backtrack.  
It works for some `grammars`.

### Bottom up

A `bottom-up parser` starts at the `leaves` and grows toward `root` of the `parse tree`.  
As input is consumed, the `parser`[^2] encodes possibilities in an internal `state`.  
The `bottom-up parser` starts in a `state` valid for legal first `tokens`.[^2]  
`Bottom-up parsers` handle a large class of `grammars`.
