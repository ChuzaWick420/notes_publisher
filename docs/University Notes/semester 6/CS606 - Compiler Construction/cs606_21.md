# Lecture No. 21

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 09-04-2025</span>

## Shift Reduce: the Stack

The shift action pushes a `terminal`[^1] on the `stack`.  
`Reduce` 

- Pops one or more symbols from the `stack` (right hand side of `production`[^1])
- Pushes a `non terminal`[^1] on the `stack` (left hand side of `production`[^1])

## Discovering Handles

The upper edge of a partially constructed `parse tree`[^2] is called its `upper frontier`.  
The `parser`[^3] must find some `substring` $\beta$ of the `upper frontier` where

- $\beta$ is the right hand side of some production $A \to \beta$ and
- $A \to \beta$ is one step in right most derivation of input stream

Each potential match is represented as a pair $<A \to \beta, k>$ where $k$ is the position on the `tree`[^2]'s current `frontier` of the right end of $\beta$.  
This `pair` is called the `handle` of the bottom up `parser`.[^3]

## Handle Pruning

The use of `stack` simplifies the `parsing algorithm` in 2 ways.

1. It trivializes the problem of managing space for the `frontier` by pushing the input characters at top of the `stack`.
2. It makes sure that all `handles` occur with their right ends at the top of the `stack`, eliminating the need to keep track of position $k$.

## Shift-reduce Parsing Algorithm

push $ onto stack  
sym ← nextToken()  
repeat until 

```python
stack.push("$")
sym = nextToken()

while (not (sym == "$" and stack[1] == "G")): # Goal symbol right above $ symbol
	if (stack.top() == "A -> B"):
		stack.pop() # pops all B
		stack.push("A")
	else if (sym != "$"):
		stack.push(sym)
		sym = nextToken()
	else:
		# report error and halt
```
