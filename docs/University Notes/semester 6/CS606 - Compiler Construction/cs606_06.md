## How to Describe Tokens

`Regular languages`[^1] are the most popular for specifying `tokens`[^2] because

- They are based on simple and useful theory.
- Are easy to understand.
- Efficient implementations exist for generating `lexical analyzers`[^2] based on such languages.

## Languages

Let $\Sigma$ be a `set`[^3] of characters. $\Sigma$ is called the `alphabet`.[^4] A `language`[^4] defined over $\Sigma$ is a `set`[^3] of `strings`[^4] of characters drawn from $\Sigma$.

### Examples

Alphabet = English letters  
Language = English sentences

Alphabet = ASCII  
Language = C++, Java, C#

Each `regular expression`[^5] is a notation for a `regular language`.[^1] If $A$ is the `regular expression`[^5] then $L(A)$ is the `regular language`.[^1]

## Regular Expressions

`Regular expression`[^5] is defined as

- $a$ for ordinary character from $\Sigma$.
- $\epsilon$ for empty `string`.[^4]
- $R | S$ means either $R$ or $S$.
- $RS$ means $R$ followed by $S$.
- $R^*$ means concatenation of $R$ zero or more times ($R^* = \epsilon | R | RR | RRR | â€¦$)

Then there are extensions to it as well

- $R?$ means $\epsilon | R$.
- $R^+$ means $RR^*$.
- $(R)$ is for grouping.
- $[abc]$ means $a | b | c$.
- $[a-z]$ means characters ranging from $a$ to $z$.
- `[^ab]` means anything except for $a$ and $b$.

## Finite Automaton

We need a mechanism to determine if the `string`[^4] $w$ belongs to $L(R)$ `language`[^4] where $R$ is the `regular expression`.[^5] Such a mechanism is called an `acceptor`.  
The `acceptor` is based on a `finite automaton`[^6] which consists of

- An input `alphabet`[^4] $\Sigma$.
- A `set`[^3] of `states`.
- A start (initial) `state`.
- A `set`[^3] of `transitions`.
- A `set`[^3] of accepting (final) `states`.
