# Lecture No. 03

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 13-03-2025</span>

A `parse` can be represented by a `parse tree` or `syntax tree`.

The deviations can be extracted by starting from the `root node` and working towards each `leaf node`.

## Abstract Syntax Tree

Sometimes the `syntax tree` contains a lot of unnecessary data and `compilers` often use `abstract syntax tree`.

`ASTs` are one kind of `intermediate representations` which are a lot more concise and summarize the grammar without the details of deviations.

## Back End

The `back end` translate the `intermediate representation` into the target `machine code`.  
The `back end`

- Ensures conformance with system interfaces.
- Decides which values to keep in `registers` to prevent memory accesses as accessing memory is slow.
- Responsible for `instruction selection` to produce fast and compact code.
- Takes advantage of the addressing modes on the target machine.

The `instruction selection` problem is viewed as a pattern matching problem that can be solved using the `dynamic programming`[^1] based algorithms.
