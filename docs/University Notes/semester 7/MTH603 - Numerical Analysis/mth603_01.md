# 01. Introduction

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 14-08-2025</span>

## Number System

In our daily life, we use $10$ symbols ($0, 1, 2, \ldots, 9$) to do calculations. This number $10$ is called the `base` of the system we are using. Therefore, with a `base` $N$, we need $0, 1, \ldots, (N - 1)$ symbols to represent any `number`.[^1]

Following systems are used in computers usually

| Base $N$ | Number      |
| -------- | ----------- |
| $2$      | Binary      |
| $8$      | Octal       |
| $10$     | Decimal     |
| $16$     | Hexadecimal |

Any arbitrary `number`[^1] can be represented as

$$
a = a_m N^m + a_{m-1} N^{m-1} + \dots + a_1 N^1 + a_0 + a_{-1}N^{-1} + \dots + a_{-m}N^{-m}
$$

The decimal `number`[^1] $1729$ is represented as

$$
(1729)_{10} = 1 \times 10^3 + 7 \times 10^2 + 2 \times 10^1 + 9 \times 10^0
$$

Computers use `bits` ($0$ or $1$ - `base 2`) to represent a `number`.[^1]

### Conversion Example

Convert $(47)_{10}$ to binary

|                        | Base | Post Division | Remainder |
| ---------------------- | ---- | ------------- | --------- |
| Starting:              | $2$  | $47$          |           |
|                        | $2$  | $23$          | $1$       |
|                        | $2$  | $11$          | $1$       |
|                        | $2$  | $5$           | $1$       |
|                        | $2$  | $2$           | $1$       |
|                        | $2$  | $1$           | $0$       |
| Most Significant `Bit` |      | $0$           | $1$       |

$$(47)_{10} = (101111)_2$$

### Conversion Example

Convert $(0.7625)_{10}$ to binary

| Fractional Part | Operation | Product  | Integer |
| :-------------- | :-------- | :------- | :------ |
| $0.7625$        | $\times2$ | $1.5250$ | $1$     |
| $0.5250$        | $\times2$ | $1.0500$ | $1$     |
| $0.0500$        | $\times2$ | $0.1000$ | $0$     |
| $0.1000$        | $\times2$ | $0.2000$ | $0$     |
| $0.2000$        | $\times2$ | $0.4000$ | $0$     |
| $0.4000$        | $\times2$ | $0.8000$ | $0$     |
| $0.8000$        | $\times2$ | $1.6000$ | $1$     |
| $0.6000$        | $\times2$ | $1.2000$ | $1$     |
| $0.1000$        | $\times2$ | $0.2000$ | $0$     |

$$(0.7625)_{10} = (0.110 \overline{00011})_2$$

> [!NOTE] The number starts from $110$ but the sequence $00011$ is represented indefinitely.

### Conversion Example

Convert $(59)_{10}$ to `binary` and than `octal`.

|                        | Base | Post Division | Remainder |
| ---------------------- | ---- | ------------- | --------- |
| Starting:              | $2$  | $59$          |           |
|                        | $2$  | $29$          | $1$       |
|                        | $2$  | $14$          | $1$       |
|                        | $2$  | $7$           | $0$       |
|                        | $2$  | $3$           | $1$       |
|                        | $2$  | $1$           | $1$       |
| Most Significant `Bit` |      | $0$           | $1$       |

$$(59)_{10} = (111011)_2$$

$$(111011)_2 = (73)_8$$
