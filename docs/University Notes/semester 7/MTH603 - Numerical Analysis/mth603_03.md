# 03. Solution of Non Linear Equations (Bisection Method)

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 14-08-2025</span>

## `Polynomials`[^1]

> [!NOTE] $f(x) = 0$ is called an algebraic equation in $x$ if it is purely a `polynomial`.[^1]

### Some Facts

1. Every equation of the form $f(x) = 0$ has at least one [root](#roots-of-an-equation) (either `real`[^2] or `complex`[^2]).
2. Every `polynomial`[^1] of $n^{th}$ degree has $n$ [roots](#roots-of-an-equation).
3. If $f(x) = 0$ is an equation of odd degree then it has at least one `real`[^2] [root](#roots-of-an-equation) whose sign is opposite to that of last term.
4. If $f(x) = 0$ is an equation of even degree whose last term is negative then it has at least one positive and at least one negative [root](#roots-of-an-equation).

## Transcendental Equation

An equation is called `transcendental` equation if it has either or a combination of the following:

- `Logarithmic`[^3] `functions`[^4]
- `Trigonometric` `functions`[^4]
- `Exponential` `functions`[^4]

## Roots of an Equation

If we have an equation $f(x) = 0$ then the values for $x$ which satisfy the equation, are called `roots`.

$$a \text{ is a root for } f(x) = 0 \iff f(a) = 0$$

## Properties of an Algebraic Equation

- `Complex`[^2] [roots](#roots-of-an-equation) appear in pairs. If $(a + \iota b)$ is a [root](#roots-of-an-equation) then $(a - \iota b)$ is also a [root](#roots-of-an-equation).
- If $f(x) = 0$ is of $n^{th}$ degree and $a$ is a [root](#roots-of-an-equation) then $(x - a)$ is a factor of $f(x)$. Diving $f(x)$ by $(x - a)$ gives us a `polynomial`[^1] of degree $n - 1$.

## Descartes Rule of Signs

> [!QUOTE] The `number`[^2] of positive [roots](#roots-of-an-equation) of an algebraic equation $f(x) = 0$ with `real`[^2] coefficients can not exceed the `number`[^2] of changes in the signs of the coefficients in the `polynomial`[^1] $f(x) = 0$. Similarly the `number`[^2] of negative [roots](#roots-of-an-equation) of the equation can not exceed the `number`[^2] of changes in the sign of coefficients of $f(-x) = 0$.

### Example

$$x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 5 = 0$$

#### Positive [Roots](#roots-of-an-equation)

Following are the sign changes that occur in the equation

1. $+$ for $x^3$ changes to $-$ for $3x^2$
2. $-$ for $3x^2$ changes to $+$ for $4x$
3. $+$ for $4x$ changes to $-$ for $5$

Since there are 3 changes so there are 3 _positive_ [roots](#roots-of-an-equation).

#### Negative [Roots](#roots-of-an-equation)

$$f(-x) = -x^3 - 3x^2 - 4x - 5$$

Since there are no changes, therefore, there are no negative [roots](#roots-of-an-equation).

## Intermediate Value Property

If $f(x)$ is a `continuous function`[^5] defined over $a \le x \le b$ such that $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ differ in their signs then, there is a `number`[^2] $\beta$ such that $a \le \beta \le b$ and $f(\beta) = 0$.

## Direct Methods

Those methods which do not require any information about the initial approximation of [root](#roots-of-an-equation) to start the solution are known as direct methods.

### Examples

- `Graefee` root squaring method
- `Gauss` elimination method
- `Gauss` Jordan method

## Iterative Methods

These methods require an initial approximation to start.

### Examples

- `Bisection` method
- `Newton Raphson` method
- `Secant` method
- `Jacobie` method

## How to Get an Initial Approximation?

Initial approximation can be found by using

### Graphical Method

$$f(x) = x - \sin(x) - 1 = 0$$

$$\implies x - 1 = \sin(x)$$

$$f_1(x) = x - 1 \quad f_2(x) = \sin(x)$$

![[mth603_i_3_1.png]]  
/// captions  
$f_1$ and $f_2$ intersect at $1.9$ and therefore, it should be taken as the initial approximation.  
///

### Analytical Method

This method can be used for 

- `Algebraic` equations
- [Transcendental equations](#transcendental-equation)

We have to locate two points $a$ and $b$ such that $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ has opposite signs.

#### Example

$$f(x) = 3x - \sqrt{1 + \sin(x)} = 0$$

$$\implies f(0) = -1$$

$$\implies f(1) = 3 - \sqrt{1 + \sin\left(1 \times \frac{180}{\pi}\right)} = 3 - \sqrt{1 + 0.84} = 1.64$$

Since $f(0)$ and $f(1)$ differ in signs, therefore, the [root](#roots-of-an-equation) lies between $0$ and $1$.

## Bisection Method (Bolzano)

Suppose that you have $f(x) = 0$ defined on the $[x_0, x_1]$ and let $f(x_0)$ and $f(x_1)$ have opposite signs such that $f(x_0)f(x_1) < 0$ then the graph crosses the $x$ axis, suggesting that there exists a [root](#roots-of-an-equation) $x_0 < x_2 < x_1$ such that

$$x_2 = \frac{x_0 + x_1}{2}$$

If $f(x_2) = 0$ then it is the [root](#roots-of-an-equation), otherwise the [root](#roots-of-an-equation) lies somewhere in either

- $[x_0, x_2]$
- $[x_2, x_1]$

Now we have 2 halves and we check which halve will contain the [root](#roots-of-an-equation).

- $f(x_0) f(x_2) < 0$ implies that the [root](#roots-of-an-equation) is in $[x_0, x_2]$
- $f(x_2) f(x_1) < 0$ implies that the [root](#roots-of-an-equation) is in $[x_2, x_1]$

And we keep repeating the process.

> [!NOTE] In numerical analysis, $\pi = 3.14$ and calculations are carried out in `radians` mode.

## Example

Solve $x^3 - 9x + 1 = 0$ for the [root](#roots-of-an-equation) between $x = 2$ and $x = 4$ by [bisection method](#bisection-method-bolzano).

### Solution

$$\because f(x) = x^3 - 9x + 1 = 0$$

$$\implies f(2) = 2^3 - 9(2) + 1 = 8 - 18 + 1 = -9$$

$$\implies f(4) = 4^3 - 9(4) + 1 = 64 - 36 + 1 = 29$$

$$\because f(2) f(4) < 0$$

$$x_0 = 2 \quad x_1 = 4$$

$$x_2 = \frac{2 + 4}{2} = 3$$

$$
f(3) = 3^3 - 9(3) + 1 = 27 - 27 + 1 = 1
$$

$$\because f(2) f(3) < 0$$

$$x_3 = \frac{2 + 3}{2} = 2.5$$

$$
f(2.5) = 2.5^3 - 9(2.5) + 1 = 15.625 - 22.5 + 1 = -5.875
$$

$$\because f(2.5) f(3) < 0$$

$$
x_4 = \frac{2.5+3}{2} = 2.75
$$

$$
x_5 = 2.875 \quad \text{and} \quad x_6 = 2.9375
$$

| $n$   | $xn$​    | $f(xn​)$  |
| --- | ------ | ------- |
| $2$   | $3$      | $1.0$     |
| $3$   | $2.5$    | $-5.875$  |
| $4$   | $2.75$   | $-2.9531$ |
| $5$   | $2.875$  | $-1.1113$ |
| $6$   | $2.9375$ | $-0.0901$ |

#### When to Stop the Process of Iteration?

Assume the accuracy was given to be $10^{-3}$ and we have 2 consecutive [roots](#roots-of-an-equation) like $2.135648$ and $2.135769$.

$$2.135769 - 2.135648 = 0.000121$$
  
Since the accuracy is achieved, we can stop here.
