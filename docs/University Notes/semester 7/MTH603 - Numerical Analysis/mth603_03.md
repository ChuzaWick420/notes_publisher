# 03. Solution of Non Linear Equations (Bisection Method)

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 14-08-2025</span>

## `Polynomials`[^1]

> [!NOTE] $f(x) = 0$ is called an algebraic equation in $x$ if it is purely a `polynomial`.[^1]

### Some Facts

1. Every equation of the form $f(x) = 0$ has at least one `root` (either `real`[^2] or `complex`[^2]).
2. Every `polynomial`[^1] of $n^{th}$ degree has $n$ `roots`.
3. If $f(x) = 0$ is an equation of odd degree then it has at least one `real`[^2] `root` whose sign is opposite to that of last term.
4. If $f(x) = 0$ is an equation of even degree whose last term is negative then it has at least one positive and at least one negative `root`.

## Transcendental Equation

An equation is called `transcendental` equation if it has either or a combination of the following:

- `Logarithmic`[^3] `functions`[^4]
- `Trigonometric` `functions`[^4]
- `Exponential` `functions`[^4]
