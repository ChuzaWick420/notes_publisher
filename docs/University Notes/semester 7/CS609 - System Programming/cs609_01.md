# 01. Introduction, means of I/O

<span style="color: gray;">Dated: 08-09-2025</span>

## What is System Programming?

It is the study of techniques which facilitates the acquisition of data from input devices such as peripherals and output devices which maybe result of processing performed by an application.

## Three Layered Approach

System Programmer can do either of the following:

1. Invoke the hardware directly
2. Use `BIOS` routines to invoke the hardware
3. Use `OS` routines to invoke `BIOS` routines which invoke the hardware.  
///

## Methods of I/O

The hardware can be programmed to perform `I/O` in 3 ways.

- Programmed `I/O`
- Interrupt driven `I/O`
- Direct Memory Access

In case of programmed `I/O`, the `CPU` waits for `I/O` device to be free so it can perform an operation and remains tied to it, mostly idling.

In case of Interrupt driven `I/O`, the `CPU` continues dealing with the `processes` and when the `I/O` device is available, it generates an `interrupt`[^1] which invokes an `Interrupt Service Routine`(`ISR`) which grabs the `CPU`'s attention to perform the `I/O` operation. This allows `I/O` device to be busy doing the `I/O` operation and `CPU` to be busy doing the processing.

Normally, the data is transferred as follows:

1. `I/O` → `CPU register` (1 bus cycle)
2. `CPU register` → `Memory` (1 bus cycle)

A `DMA` (`Direct Memory Access`) controller can control the `system bus`, allow data transfer in 1 bus cycle as `I/O` $\leftrightarrow$ `CPU`.

## `I/O` Controller

![[cs609_e_1_2.svg]]  
/// caption  
`I/O` is not connected to `CPU` directly but rather through a middle man called `I/O Controller`.  
///

The functions of this `I/O controller` are as follows

- `I/O` control signals
- Buffering
- Error Correction and Detection

Some of these `controllers` include

- `DMA controller`
- `Interrupt controller`
- `Programmable Peripheral Interface` (`PPI`)
- `Interval Timer`
- `Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter`

## Operating Systems

`Operating systems` use `data structures` or `tables` for management of computer resources.

## File Management

The directory structure is formed by data structures such as

- `FAT` (versions include `12`, `16`, `32-bits`)
- `BPB`(`BIOS` parameter block)
- `DPB`(drive parameter block)
- `FCBs` (file control block)

## Memory Management

Standard PC operate in two mode in terms of memory which are

- Real Mode
- Protected Mode

In `real mode`, the `CPU` can only access first MB of the memory. To control this section of memory, `DOS` uses following `data structures`

- `FCB` (`File control block`)
- `PSP` (`Program segment prefix`)

Operating systems operating in `protected mode` make use of following `data structures`

- Local Descriptor Table
- Global Descriptor Table
- Interrupt Descriptor Table

## Viruses and Vaccines

There are various types of `viruses` but we will discuss those which embed themselves within the program or executable code which are 

- `Executable file viruses`
- `Partition Table` or `boot sector viruses`

## Device Drivers

A `device driver` contains the `routines` which perform `I/O` operations on the `device`.

---

`CPU` sends data on the `data lines` and then sends the `STROBE` signal to the device. This then allows the device to get the input data and start its output and while it is busy, it sends `BUSY` signal to `CPU`. The `data ready` signal allows `CPU` to take input from the device.

## Interrupts

### Types

- Hardware (invoked by hardware `controller` generally)
- Software (invoked by software)

### Mechanism

- Operating system
	- `DOS`'s `kernel` is `io.sys` which loads at boot time.
	- `Window`'s `kernel` is `kernel32.dll` or `kernel.dll`.
- `Interrupts` supported by `ROM BIOS` are loaded in `ROM` section of the main memory which starts at location `F000:0000H`.
- Some device drivers also come with `interrupts` which are loaded into `ISR`.

---

A standard PC has `256` `interrupts` which are placed inside a `1024-byte` sized table called `Interrupt Vector Table` (`IVT`) where each address is `4 bytes` long. So the `interrupt` number is used to index into `IVT`.
