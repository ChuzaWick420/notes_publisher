# Vector Valued Functions

The `functions`[^1] which have `real numbers` as their `domain`[^1] and 2D or 3D `vectors`[^2] as their `range`,[^1] are called `vector valued functions`.

## 2D

$$\vec{r}(t) = \langle\vec{x}(t), \vec{y}(t)\rangle = x(t)\hat{i} + y(t)\hat{j}$$

## 3D

$$\vec{r}(t) = \langle\vec{x}(t), \vec{y}(t), \vec{z}(t)\rangle = x(t)\hat{i} + y(t)\hat{j} + z\hat{k}$$

## Graphs of `Vector Valued Functions`

Let us say we have this `vector valued function`.  

$$\vec{r}(t) = \langle\vec{x}(t), \vec{y}(t)\rangle = x(t)\hat{i} + y(t)\hat{j}$$

As $t$ varies, we get a `vector`[^2] whose tail is at `origin` and head moves along a curve $C$.  
This `vector` is called the `position` or `radius vector` $\vec{OC}$ and $C$ is the graph.

## Example

$$\vec{r}(t) = \hat{i} \cos(t) + \hat j \sin (t)$$

$$\because \vec{r}(t) = x \hat i + y \hat j$$

$$x \hat i + y \hat j= \hat{i} \cos(t) + \hat j \sin (t)$$

This shows  

$$x = \cos (t)$$

$$y = \sin (t)$$

which are parametric equations of a `circle` where $t$ is $\theta$.

## Example

$$\vec{r}(t) = \hat{i} \cdot a \cdot \cos(t) + \hat j \cdot b \cdot \sin (t) + \hat z \cdot c \cdot t$$

Where $a, b, c$ are `constants`.  
Let us inspect this equation closely, the $\hat i$ and $\hat j$ components create a `circle`.  
Then we have $\hat z$ whose coefficient changes as $t$ changes, defining a changing `height`.  
The graph it creates is a `circular helix`.
