# Extrema of `functions`[^1] with Two Variables

## Absolute Maximum

A `function`[^1] is said to have `absolute maximum` on the `domain`[^1] $\mathbb{R}^2$ if there is a point $(x_0, y_0) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ such that  

$$f(x_0, y_0) \ge f(x, y) \text{ for all } (x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2$$

## Absolute Minimum

Similarly, `absolute minimum` exists if  

$$f(x_0, y_0) \le f(x, y) \text{ for all } (x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2$$

## Relative or Local Maximum

The `function`[^1] is said to have `relative maximum` at point $(x_0, y_0)$ if there exists an open disk $K$ centered at $(x_0, y_0)$, of radius $r$.  

$$f(x_0, y_0) \ge f(x, y) \text{ for all } (x, y) \in K$$

$$\text{where } K = \{(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : (x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2 < r^2\}$$

## Relative or Local Minimum

Similarly, for `relative minimum`, we have  

$$f(x_0, y_0) \le f(x, y) \text{ for all } (x, y) \in K$$

## Extreme Value Theorem

If $f(x, y)$ is `continuous`[^2] on a closed and bounded set $R$ then the `function`[^1] has `absolute maximum` and `absolute minimum` on $R$.  
If a `function`[^1] has `relative extrema` at $(x_0, y_0)$, then  

$$f_x(x_0, y_0) = f_y(x_0, y_0) = 0$$

## Saddle point

If $f(x, y)$ has a disk $K$ centered at $(a, b)$ and there exists points $(x, y)$ in its `domain`[^1] such that $f(x, y) > f(a, b)$ and $f(x, y) < f(a, b)$ then this point on `surface` $f(a, b, f(a, b))$ is called `saddle point`.
