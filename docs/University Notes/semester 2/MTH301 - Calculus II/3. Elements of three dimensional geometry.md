# Elements of Three Dimensional Geometry

## `Distance` In 3D

Imagine we have 2 points in `space`, $P(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $Q(x_2, y_2, z_2)$, then the `distance formula` for these points will be  

$$\lvert \overline{PQ} \rvert = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}$$

## `Midpoint` Of 2 Points

If $R$ is the `midpoint` between $\overline{PQ}$ then it can be defined as  

$$R\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}, \frac{z_1 + z_2}{2}\right)$$

## Directional `Angles`

The `angles` $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are the `angles` between the `line`[^1](or you can say its shadows on the $xy$, $yz$ and $xz$ `planes`[^2]) and the $x$, $y$ and $z$ axes respectively.

> [!note] $\gamma$ can work in both $xz$ and $yz$ `planes`[^2]

## Directional Ratios

The `cosines` of `directional angles` are called `directional cosines`.  
And any multiple of `directional cosines` are called `directional ratios`.

Let us talk about the shadow on the $xy$ `plane`.[^2]

$$\cos \alpha = \frac x r = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}$$

$$\cos \beta = \frac y r = \frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}$$

$$\cos \gamma = \frac z r = \frac{z}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}$$

$$\therefore \cos^2 \alpha + \cos^2 \beta + \cos^2 \gamma = 1$$

For a `line`,[^1] joining $P(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $Q(x_2, y_2, z_2)$, the `directional cosines` are  

$$\cos \alpha = \frac{x_2 - x_1}{\lvert \overline{PQ} \rvert}$$

$$\cos \beta = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{\lvert \overline{PQ} \rvert}$$

$$\cos \gamma = \frac{z_2 - z_1}{\lvert \overline{PQ} \rvert}$$

## Intersection of 2 Non-parallel `planes`[^2]

The intersection between 2 non-parallel `planes`[^2] creates a `line`.[^1]  
Their intersection gives us simultaneous `equations` which are called `non symmetric` form of equations of a straight `line`.[^1]

| **Region** | **Description**                        | **Equation**   |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| xy plane   | consists of points of form $(x, y, 0)$ | $z = 0$        |
| yz plane   | consists of points of form $(0, y, z)$ | $x = 0$        |
| xz plane   | consists of points of form $(x, 0, z)$ | $y = 0$        |
| x axis     | consists of points of form $(x, 0, 0)$ | $y = 0, z = 0$ |
| y axis     | consists of points of form $(0, y, 0)$ | $x = 0, z = 0$ |
| z axis     | consists of points of form $(0, 0, z)$ | $x = 0, y = 0$ |

## General Equation of `plane`[^2]

$$ax + by + cz + d = 0$$

where $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d \in \mathbb{R}$ .

## Equation of Sphere

$$\sqrt{(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2 + (z - z_0)^2} = r$$

Where $r$ is the `radius` of the `sphere` centered at $O(x_0, y_0, z_0)$.

## Equation of a Right Circular Cone

$$\phi = \frac \pi 4$$

$$z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$

Here $\phi$ is $\gamma$.

## Elliptic Cylinder

From the equation of `ellipse`  

$$\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = r^2$$

We can also introduce a 3rd axis $z = c$ to define the `height`,
