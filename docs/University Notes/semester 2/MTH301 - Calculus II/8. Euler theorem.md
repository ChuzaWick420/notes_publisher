# More about Euler's Theorem Chain Rule

In general, the order of the `nth partial derivative`[^1] can be changed without affecting the final result whenever the `function`[^2] and all of its `partial derivative` of order $\le n$ are `continuous`.[^3]  
If the first 3 `partial derivatives`[^1] are `continuous`[^3] then  

$$f_{xyy} = f_{yxy} = f_{yyx}$$

Or in another notation,

$$
\frac{\partial^3 f}{\partial y^2 \partial x}
=
\frac{\partial^3 f}{\partial y \partial x \partial y}
=
\frac{\partial^3 f}{\partial x \partial y^2}
$$

## The `Chain Rule`[^4]

If $y$ is a `function`[^2] of $w$ which is a `function`[^2] of $v$ which is a `function`[^2] of $x$ ultimately then  

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{dw} \cdot \frac{dw}{dv} \cdot \frac{dv}{dx}$$

Now imagine we have $w = f(x, y)$ and $x = g(t)$ and $y = f(t)$  
then  

$$\frac{dw}{dt} = \frac{\partial w}{\partial x} \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial y} \frac{dy}{dt}$$

### Example

$$w = xy, x = \cos t, \text{ and } y = \sin t$$

 $$ \frac{\partial w}{\partial y} = x \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial w}{\partial x} = y $$

 $$ \frac{dx}{dt} = -\sin t, \quad \frac{dy}{dt} = \cos t $$

 $$ \frac{dw}{dt} = \frac{\partial w}{\partial x} \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial y} \frac{dy}{dt} $$

 $$ = (\sin t)(-\sin t) + (\cos t)(\cos t) $$

 $$ = -\sin^2 t + \cos^2 t = \cos 2t $$
