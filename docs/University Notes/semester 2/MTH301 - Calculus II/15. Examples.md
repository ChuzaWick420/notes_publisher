# Examples

## Example

$$f(x) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$

$$f_x(x,y) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}$$

$$f_y(x,y) = \frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}$$

The `partial derivatives`[^1] exists at all points except for `origin`.  

$$f_x = 0 \text{ only if } x = 0$$

$$f_y = 0 \text{ only if } y = 0$$

The only `critical point`[^2] is $(0, 0)$ and $f(0, 0) = 0$  
Since, $f(x, y) \ge 0$ for all $(x, y)$, $f(0, 0) = 0$ is the `absolute minimum`[^3] value of $f$.

## Second `Partial Derivative`[^1] Test

$$D = f_{xx}(x_0, y_0) \cdot f_{yy}(x_0, y_0) - f^2_{xy}(x_0, y_0)$$

1. If $D > 0$ and $f_{xx}(x_0, y_0) > 0$ then $f(x, y)$ has `relative minimum`[^3] at $(x_0, y_0)$
2. If $D > 0$ and $f_{xx}(x_0, y_0) < 0$ then $f(x, y)$ has `relative maximum`[^3] at $(x_0, y_0)$
3. If $D < 0$ then $f(x, y)$ has a `saddle point`[^3] at $(x_0, y_0)$
4. If $D = 0$ then no conclusion can be drawn.

## Example

$$f(x, y) = 2x^2 - 4x + xy^2 - 1$$

$$f_x(x, y) = 4x - 4 + y^2 \text{ and } f_{xx}(x, y) = 4$$

$$f_y(x, y) = 2xy \text{ and } f_{yy}(x, y) = 2x$$

$$f_{xy}(x, y) = f_{yx}(x, y) = 2y$$

Putting the `partial derivatives`[^1] equal to $0$, we have  

$$4x - 4 + y^2 = 0$$

$$2xy = 0$$

Try solving for variables and we will get following `critical points`[^2]  

$$(1, 0)$$

$$(0, 2)$$

$$(0 ,-2)$$

Checking the nature of the points  

$$f_{xx}(1, 0) = 4$$

$$f_{yy}(1, 0) = 2$$

$$f_{xy}(1, 0) = 0$$

$$D = f_{xx}(1, 0) \cdot f_{yy}(1, 0) - f_{xy}^2(1, 0)$$

$$D = 4 \cdot 2 - 0^2 = 8 > 0$$

Hence, the `function`[^4] $f(x, y)$ has `relative minimum`[^3] at $(1, 0)$

$$f_{xx}(0, -2) = 4$$

$$f_{yy}(0, -2) = 0$$

$$f_{xy}(0, -2) = -4$$

$$D = f_{xx}(0, -2) \cdot f_{yy}(0, -2) - f_{xy}^2(0, -2)$$

$$D = 4 \cdot 0 - (-4)^2 = -16 < 0$$

Hence, the `function`[^4] $f(x, y)$ has `saddle point`[^3] at $(0, -2)$  

$$f_{xx}(0, 2) = 4$$

$$f_{yy}(0, 2) = 0$$

$$f_{xy}(0, 2) = 4$$

$$D = f_{xx}(0, 2) \cdot f_{yy}(0, 2) - f_{xy}^2(0, 2)$$

$$D = 4 \cdot 0 - 4^2 = -16 < 0$$

Hence, the `function`[^4] $f(x, y)$ has `saddle point`[^3] at $(0, 2)$
