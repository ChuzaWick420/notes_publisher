# Introduction

## Differential Calculus

It deals with problem of finding:

1. Rates of change.
2. `Slopes` of `curves`.

### Applications

It can be used to find following things:

- `Velocities` and `acceleration` of moving bodies.
- Firing angles for cannons to achieve maximum `height` or travel `distance`.
- The times when planets are closest to each other.

## Integral Calculus

Deals with the problem of determining a `function`[^1] from the information of its `rate of change`.

### Applications

1. Calculating length of `curves`.
2. Finding `areas` of irregular regions in a `plane`.[^2]
3. Finding `volumes` and `masses` of arbitrary solids.
4. Knowledge about acting `forces` and `position` of a body in future, relative to present time.

## Reference Axes

Just like `planes`,[^2] we can define a `space` with 3 axes, $x$, $y$ and $z$.  
The `planes`,[^2] $x = 0$, $y = 0$ and $z = 0$ divide the `space` into 8 `octants`.  
The `origin` of the `space` lies at $(0, 0, 0)$ and any point in `space` will have 3 coordinate values.

Following are the `signs` for coordinate values in each `octant`.

1. (+, +, +)
2. (-, +, +)
3. (-, -, +)
4. (+, -, +)
5. (+, +, -)
6. (-, +, -)
7. (-, -, -)
8. (+, -, -)

## `Functions`[^1] With Multiple `Variables`

A `function`[^1] can depend on multiple `variables`.

### Example

$$A = lw$$

$$V = lwh$$
