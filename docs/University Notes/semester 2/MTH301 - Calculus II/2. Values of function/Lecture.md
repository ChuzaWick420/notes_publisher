# Values of `Functions`[^1]
## `Function`[^1] In One `variable`

$$f(x) = x^2$$

Try putting in different values, we get  

$$f(1) = 1^2 = 1$$

$$f(3) = 3^2 = 9$$

## `Function`[^1] In Two `variable`

$$f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$$

Try putting in different values, we get  

$$f(1, 3) = 1^2 + 3^2 = 10$$

$$f(3, 3) = 3^2 + 3^2 = 18$$

## `Function`[^1] In Three `variable`

$$f(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$$

Try putting in different values, we get  

$$f(1, 3, 5) = 1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 = 35$$

$$f(2, 2, 4) = 2^2 + 2^2 + 4^2 = 24$$

## `Function`[^1] In $n$ `variable`

$$f(x_1, x_2, \ldots,x_n)$$
