# Getting Started

## Pre-requisites

- `Python`  

## Installation

To install, run the following in your `terminal`

```
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -U matplotlib
```

> If this command results in `Matplotlib` being compiled from source and there's trouble with the compilation, you can add `--prefer-binary` to select the newest version of `Matplotlib` for which there is a precompiled wheel for your OS and Python.
