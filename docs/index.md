## Me

I am a Computer Science student, a curious person who  
- Loves to learn cool things such as a concept in Mathematics or Computer Science, a new technology or maybe even a new programming language.  
- Thinks deeply about things such as philosophy of nature, mathematics, programming and their connections with each oher.  
- Crafts creative things such as games, graphics and other cool things.

I do not claim to be good at all the things I do. It is just that I love doing them.

## Disclaimer

Due to the scale of the project and limitation of time, it is hard to write things effectively and manage them, which causes the website to go through organizational changes and edits over time. Therefore, it is not recommended to use any of the pages as references through hyperlinks.
