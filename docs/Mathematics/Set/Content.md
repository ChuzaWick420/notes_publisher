# Definition
A `set` is a collection of well defined distinct `objects`.  
These `objects` are called `members` or `elements` of the `set`.

# Ways to Describe a Set
The ways to describe a `set` are following

## Descriptive Method
A `set` may be described in terms of English words.

### Example
Set of all cities in Pakistan.

## Tabular Method
A `set` may be described by listing all of its `elements`.

### Example

$$\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots \}$$

## Set Builder Method
A `set` maybe be described by stating the symbols and describing the property that is common between all `elements`.

### Example

$$\mathbb{W} = \{x | x \ge 0 \land x < \infty\}$$

# Subsets and Supersets
`Sets` can contain other `sets`.  
Let us take an example of $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{Z}$ sets.  

$$\forall x \in \mathbb{N} \implies x \in \mathbb{Z} \implies \mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{Z}$$

Here we say that $\mathbb{N}$ is a `subset` of $\mathbb{Z}$.  
We can also say that $\mathbb{Z}$ is a `superset` of $\mathbb{N}$  

$$\mathbb{Z} \supset \mathbb{N}$$

# Operations on Set
Let's understand with a example.  
Let's take 2 `sets`, `A` and `B` for example.

$$A = \{1, 2\}$$

$$B = \{2, 3\}$$

## Union
`Union` is a `binary operator` which takes 2 sets as input and then produces another `set` as output which contains `elements` which belong to either `set`.  

$$A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3\}$$

## Intersection
`Intersection` is also a `binary operator` which takes 2 sets as input and then produces another `set` as output which contain only those `elements` which are common to both `sets`.  

$$A \cap B = \{2\}$$
