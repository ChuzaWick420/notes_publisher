# Real line

A `line` which is used as a model to represent `real numbers`,[^1] is called 

- `Number line`
- `Real line`
- `Coordinate line`  

We take $0$ as our center and reference (called the `origin`) by which we will be taking measurements.  

By convention, the positive `numbers`[^1] are represented on the right side of the `origin` and negative `numbers`[^1] are represented on the left.

Let's say, we define a `unit` of `length` as `r`.

Then our `number line` looks as follows.

> [!NOTE] The `number line` is not limited to `integers`[^1] when it comes to representation. It can represent all the `real numbers`.[^1]
