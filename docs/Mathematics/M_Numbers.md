# Numbers

## Linguistic Definition

A number is a symbol which denotes some quantity.

## Example

If we say, "there are 5 books on the table" then the symbol $5$ is representing the quantity or amount of books.

## Types

Following are the types of [numbers](#numbers).

- [Natural numbers](#natural-numbers)
- [Odd numbers](#odd-numbers)
- [Even numbers](#even-numbers)
- [Whole numbers](#whole-numbers)
- [Integer numbers](#integer-numbers)
- [Rational numbers](#rational-numbers)
- [Irrational numbers](#irrational-numbers)
- [Real numbers](#real-numbers)
- [Complex numbers](#complex-numbers)

## Natural Numbers

The `set`[^1] of `natural` [numbers](#numbers) is a `union`[^1] between `sets`[^1] of [odd](#odd-numbers) and [even numbers](#even-numbers).  

$$\mathbb N = \mathbb O \, \cup \, \mathbb E$$

$$\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$$

## Even Numbers

By definition, an `even` [number](#numbers) is such a [number](#numbers) which can be divided by $2$.  
Assume $n$ be any [number](#numbers).  
Then $q$ is an `even` [number](#numbers) if $q = 2n$ because now $q$ can be divided by $2$.  

$$\mathbb E = \{2, 4, 6, \ldots\}$$

$$\mathbb E = \{x : x = 2n \quad \land n \in \mathbb Z\}$$

## Odd Numbers

An `odd` number is a [number](#numbers) which is _not_ divisible by $2$.  
Intuitively, every [even number](#even-numbers) is succeeded by an `odd` [number](#numbers).  
Therefore  

$$\mathbb O = \{x:x = 2n + 1 \quad n \in \mathbb Z\}$$

$$\mathbb O = \{1, 3, 5, \ldots\}$$

## Whole Numbers

The `set`[^1] of `whole` [numbers](#numbers) is just the `set`[^1] of [natural numbers](#natural-numbers) with the addition of $0$ `element`.[^1]  

$$\mathbb W = \{0\} \, \cup \, \mathbb N$$

$$\mathbb W = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots\}$$

## Integer Numbers

So far, we have only seen `sets`[^1] of positive [numbers](#numbers).  
The `set`[^1] of `integers` contains all the previous [numbers](#numbers) and their negatives.  

$$\mathbb Z = \mathbb Z^+ \, \cup \, \{0\} \, \cup \, \mathbb Z^-$$

Where

$$\mathbb Z ^ + = \mathbb N$$

Intuitively,  

$$\mathbb Z^- = \{-1, -2, -3, \ldots\}$$

$$\therefore \mathbb Z = \{0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \ldots\}$$

## Rational Numbers

The [numbers](#numbers) which can be represented as `fractions` $\frac p q$ where $p, q \in \mathbb Z \land q \neq 0$ are called `rational` [numbers](#numbers).  
These are represented by $\mathbb Q$.

## Irrational Numbers

From the definition of [rational numbers](#rational-numbers), these are the [numbers](#numbers) which cannot be represented using `fractions` i.e. $\frac p q$ where $p, q \in \mathbb Z \land q \neq 0$.  
These are represented by $\mathbb Q^\prime$.

### Examples

- $\pi$
- $e$

## Real Numbers

The `set`[^1] of `real` [numbers](#numbers) is a `union`[^1] between `sets`[^1] of [rational](#rational-numbers) and [irrational numbers](#irrational-numbers).  

$$\mathbb R = \mathbb Q \, \cup \, \mathbb Q^\prime$$
