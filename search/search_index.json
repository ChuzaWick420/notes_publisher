This extra bit that won\u2019t fit in the target register is placed in the carry flag where it can be used and tested. P Parity Parity is the number of \u201cone\u201d bits in a binary number. Parity is either odd or even. This information is normally used in communications to verify the integrity of data sent from the sender to the receiver. A Auxiliary Carry A number in base 16 is called a hex number and can be represented by 4 bits. The collection of 4 bits is called a nibble. During addition or subtraction if a carry goes from one nibble to the next this flag is set. Carry flag is for the carry from the whole addition while auxiliary carry is the carry from the first nibble to the second. Z Zero Flag The Zero flag is set if the last mathematical or logical instruction has produced a zero in its destination. S Sign Flag A signed number is represented in its two\u2019s complement form in the computer. The most significant bit (MSB) of a negative number in this representation is 1 and for a positive number it is zero. The sign bit of the last mathematical or logical operation\u2019s destination is copied into the sign flag. T Trap Flag The trap flag has a special role in debugging which will be discussed later. I Interrupt Flag It tells whether the processor can be interrupted from outside or not. Sometimes the programmer doesn\u2019t want a particular task to be interrupted so the Interrupt flag can be zeroed for this time. The programmer rather than the processor sets this flag since the programmer knows when interruption is okay and when it is not. Interruption can be disabled or enabled by making this bit zero or one, respectively, using special instructions. D Direction Flag Specifically related to string instructions, this flag tells whether the current operation has to be done from bottom to top of the block (D=0) or from top to bottom of the block (D=1). O Overflow Flag The overflow flag is set during signed arithmetic, e.g. addition or subtraction, when the sign of the destination changes unexpectedly. The actual process sets the overflow flag whenever the carry into the MSB is different from the carry out of the MSB","tags":["university-notes"]},{"location":"Archives/CS401%20-%20Assembly%20Language/3.%20Intro%20to%20assembly%203/Lecture/#segment-registerscs-ds-ss-es","title":"Segment Registers(CS, DS, SS, ES)","text":"<p>Code, Data, Stack and Extra segment register are related to Intel Segmented memory model.</p>","tags":["university-notes"]},{"location":"Archives/CS401%20-%20Assembly%20Language/3.%20Intro%20to%20assembly%203/Lecture/#our-first-program","title":"Our First Program","text":"<p>We will write our 1st program which adds 3 numbers.</p>","tags":["university-notes"]},{"location":"Archives/CS401%20-%20Assembly%20Language/3.%20Intro%20to%20assembly%203/Lecture/#english-language-version","title":"English Language Version","text":"<pre><code>move 5 to ax  \nmove 10 to bx  \nadd bx to ax  \nmove 15 to bx  \nadd bx to ax\n</code></pre>","tags":["university-notes"]},{"location":"Archives/CS401%20-%20Assembly%20Language/3.%20Intro%20to%20assembly%203/Lecture/#assembly-language-version","title":"Assembly Language Version","text":"<pre><code>operation destination, source\noperation destination\noperation source\noperation\n</code></pre> <p>These are the four variants.</p> <pre><code>[org 0x0100]\n    mov ax, 5    ;load 5 into ax register\n    mov bx, 10   ;load 10 into bx register\n    add ax, bx   ;add ax and bx and store it in ax\n    mov bx, 15   ;load 15 into bx register\n    add ax, bx   ;add ax and bx and store it in ax\n    mov ax, 0x4c00    ;terminate the program\n    int 0x21\n</code></pre>","tags":["university-notes"]},{"location":"Archives/CS401%20-%20Assembly%20Language/3.%20Intro%20to%20assembly%203/Lecture/#assembler-linker-debugger","title":"Assembler, Linker, Debugger","text":"<pre><code>nasm ex01.asm \u2013o ex01.com \u2013l ex01.lst\n</code></pre> <p>This takes <code>ex01.asm</code> file, assembles into <code>ex01.com</code> executable and makes a <code>ex01.lst</code> listing file which contains the code without comments.</p> <pre><code>00000000:B80500          mov ax, 5\n00000003:BB0A00          mov bx, 10\n00000006:01D8            add ax, bx\n00000008:BB0F00          mov bx, 15\n0000000B:01D8            add ax, bx\n0000000D:B8004C          mov ax, 0x4C00\n00000010:CD21            int 0x21\n</code></pre> <p>The first column is the <code>offset</code> of listed instructions in the output file.

The three <code>vertices</code> of a <code>triangle</code> are guaranteed to lie on a plane; any polygon with four or more <code>vertices</code> might not. Nonplanar <code>polygons</code> can be viewed from some orientation such that the edges cross each other, and <code>OpenGL</code> might not render such polygons correctly.</li> <li>There's always a trade off between performance and quality.

This is the basic idea of <code>relaxation method</code>. To achieve the fast convergence of the procedure, we take all terms to one side and then reorder the equations so that the largest negative coefficients in the equations appear on the <code>diagonal</code>.
