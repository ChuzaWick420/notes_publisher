This extra bit that won\u2019t fit in the target register is placed in the carry flag where it can be used and tested. P Parity Parity is the number of \u201cone\u201d bits in a binary number. Parity is either odd or even. This information is normally used in communications to verify the integrity of data sent from the sender to the receiver. A Auxiliary Carry A number in base 16 is called a hex number and can be represented by 4 bits. The collection of 4 bits is called a nibble. During addition or subtraction if a carry goes from one nibble to the next this flag is set. Carry flag is for the carry from the whole addition while auxiliary carry is the carry from the first nibble to the second. Z Zero Flag The Zero flag is set if the last mathematical or logical instruction has produced a zero in its destination. S Sign Flag A signed number is represented in its two\u2019s complement form in the computer. The most significant bit (MSB) of a negative number in this representation is 1 and for a positive number it is zero. The sign bit of the last mathematical or logical operation\u2019s destination is copied into the sign flag. T Trap Flag The trap flag has a special role in debugging which will be discussed later. I Interrupt Flag It tells whether the processor can be interrupted from outside or not. Sometimes the programmer doesn\u2019t want a particular task to be interrupted so the Interrupt flag can be zeroed for this time. The programmer rather than the processor sets this flag since the programmer knows when interruption is okay and when it is not. Interruption can be disabled or enabled by making this bit zero or one, respectively, using special instructions. D Direction Flag Specifically related to string instructions, this flag tells whether the current operation has to be done from bottom to top of the block (D=0) or from top to bottom of the block (D=1).

This is because real-world data often closely approximates these theoretical curves, making it valid to use the properties of mathematical curves to assist in analysis.</p>","tags":["university-notes"]},{"location":"Archives/STA301%20-%20Statistics%20and%20Probability/STA301_05/#types-of-frequency-curves","title":"Types of Frequency Curves","text":"","tags":["university-notes"]},{"location":"Archives/STA301%20-%20Statistics%20and%20Probability/STA301_05/#symmetrical-frequency-curve","title":"Symmetrical Frequency Curve","text":"<p>If we place a vertical mirror right in middle, it would reflect the curve perfectly.</p> <p></p>","tags":["university-notes"]},{"location":"Archives/STA301%20-%20Statistics%20and%20Probability/STA301_05/#moderately-skewed-frequency-curve","title":"Moderately Skewed Frequency Curve","text":"","tags":["university-notes"]},{"location":"Archives/STA301%20-%20Statistics%20and%20Probability/STA301_05/#positively-skewed","title":"Positively Skewed","text":"<p>it is the curve whose right tail is longer than the left one.</p> <p></p>","tags":["university-notes"]},{"location":"Archives/STA301%20-%20Statistics%20and%20Probability/STA301_05/#negatively-skewed","title":"Negatively Skewed","text":"<p>it is the curve whose left tail is longer than the right one. </p>","tags":["university-notes"]},{"location":"Archives/STA301%20-%20Statistics%20and%20Probability/STA301_05/#extremely-skewed-frequency-curve","title":"Extremely Skewed Frequency Curve","text":"","tags":["university-notes"]},{"location":"Archives/STA301%20-%20Statistics%20and%20Probability/STA301_05/#positively-extremely-skewed","title":"Positively Extremely Skewed","text":"<p>This one is also called <code>J shaped</code>. </p> <p>This situation arises when the highest frequency is at the end of the frequency table.

The three <code>vertices</code> of a <code>triangle</code> are guaranteed to lie on a plane; any polygon with four or more <code>vertices</code> might not. Nonplanar <code>polygons</code> can be viewed from some orientation such that the edges cross each other, and <code>OpenGL</code> might not render such polygons correctly.</li> <li>There's always a trade off between performance and quality.
